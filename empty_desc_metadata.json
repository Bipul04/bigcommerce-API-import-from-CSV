Each pump is completely disassembled, thoroughly inspected and all worn parts replaced with genuine OEM Stanadyne components. The pump is then cleaned, reassembled and precisely calibrated to factory specifications. One weak point on Stanadyne DB2 pumps that is often ignored by most rebuilders is the advance bore. The aluminum housing tends to wear out quickly where the steel advance piston is located, causing poor pump timing, poor fuel mileage, excess smoke and low power. We address this problem by utilizing a steel sleeve in the advance bore. This gives us a more precise pump calibration and a superior injection pump that will last considerably longer.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">All DB2 injection pumps include a 1-year warranty.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"><b><font color=\"red\">NOTE:</font></b> The pumps we have listed for sale here will cover most GM 6.2L and 6.5L trucks with the Stanadyne DB2 pump. If your pump is not listed for sale on this page, then it may supersede to a different part number. Please refer to the <a href=\"#DB2List\">Complete GM DB2 Pump List</a> at the bottom of this page to help find the correct pump for your truck. You can also send your pump to us for rebuild.

The Stanadyne DS4 electronic diesel fuel injection pump has marked its place in diesel history. We rebuilt hundreds of them under the GM warranty service period before they finally got all the bugs worked out. Some of them passed through our doors 2-3 times or more before the customer could actually get their truck out of the driveway. GM and Stanadyne took a huge gamble when they neglected to do some proper testing on their new system, but the good news is that the DS4 injection pump is actually a pretty solid and reliable unit now. The PMD is still an issue, but we've even got the answers to all of your PMD problems that will eliminate your hot hard starting and intermittent stalling issues. We also have some great performance upgrades for the electronics, exhaust system, intake and turbocharger that will help you get some better fuel economy and some really decent horsepower gains. If you don't see the 6.5L diesel turbo performance upgrades that you're looking for here, then please call us.</p>",

The PMD (Pump Mounted Driver) is prone to failure from constant heating and cooling when mounted inside the engine compartment and needs to be moved out in order to assure maximum performance and long service life. Our 6.5L PMD Cooler Kit conveniently mounts your new pump mounted driver (PMD) on the intake manifold. This is a very nice, tidy installation and provides much cooler and more consistent temperatures that will keep the PMD from failing. Also, when using our relocation kit, there is no need to remove the intake manifold from the engine because the old PMD can simply stay mounted to the injection pump.",

They experienced\r\nsome injector issues early on, but quickly addressed the problems.\r\nThe mighty 6.6L Duramax pumped out a respectable 300HP right off the showroom\r\nfloor. The absence of restrictive emissions on the LB7 allowed owners to get\r\nmore miles between fill ups than most people thought possible from a 3/4 ton\r\npickup. Most modern diesel engines have great potential for power and economy\r\ngains over the factory set up, and the LB7 is no exception. We always like\r\nto suggest a cold air intake kit and a free flowing exhaust system to lower\r\nEGT's and increase MPG's and power. A good tuner will help you pull those steep\r\nhills with ease and also get you some great power and economy gains. We also carry turbochargers as well as LB7 injectors and CP3 pumps to keep your fuel system in shape. If you don't see what you're looking for, then please give us a call! </p>",

Early problems with the LB7 injectors included crankcase dilution caused by cracks that developed near the fuel inlet fitting. Bosch has fixed this problem and also made improvements to the nozzle seat retention to improve injector performance. Signs of worn Duramax injectors may include excessive smoke, rough idle or a light \"miss\", low power, and poor fuel economy. LB7 owners can extend the life of their injectors by using Stanadyne Performance Formula with every tank of fuel. Clean fuel is very important, so changing your fuel filters at the recommended intervals is critical. Adding an aftermarket fuel filter or a FASS will also extend the life of your injectors.

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

In 2006, the LLY featured some more extensive mechanical changes such as connecting rods, heads and injectors, but the initial LLY was basically the same engine as it's predecessor. A few things you may notice on the LLY when you pop the hood open is the introduction of some mandatory emissions equipment such as an EGR system and a variable geometry turbocharger (VGT). Ironically, better emissions didn't help the LLY's fuel economy. But fortunately, we can help you reclaim some of that with an intake kit, exhaust system or tuner. Whether you're looking for power, economy or just some filters to keep your truck serviced, then you can find it here. If you don't see what you're looking for, then please call us!</p>",

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

The LBZ had few mechanical\r\nchanges from it's predecessor, but it came charging out of the gates with a\r\nnoticeable 50 extra ponies under the hood. How did they do that? They simply\r\nre-programming the computer much the way we do it with an aftermarket performance\r\ntuner. The results were an impressive 360HP with no modifications! The good\r\nnews doesn't stop there though, because we can still help you improve on a good\r\nthing. We have a great selection of tuners, intake kits and exhaust systems\r\nto squeeze even more power and fuel mileage from your LBZ engine than ever before.\r\nIn fact, whether you want to hear your Duramax LBZ roar, or just keep it on\r\nthe road, then we have everything you need right here.

As with previous models, GM made few changes to the engine which proves once again that the Duramax is a solid engine and GM didn't see the need to make any major changes to the sturdy 360HP beast. But there were a few mandatory changes to the emissions system, most noticeably being the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) located underneath the truck. The job of the DPF is to filter the used particulates from the exhaust before they reach the air. It works very well too. But unfortunately, what's good for the air isn't necessarily good for fuel economy. As always though, we have a few tricks up our sleeve that can help you reclaim a few of those MPG's, and also help you put a few more ponies to the ground. If you have problems finding anything you need for your Duramax LMM, then just grab your phone and give us a call at (800) 823-4444.</p>",

This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>\r\n\r\n",

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

This year the engine internals were\r\nstrengthened and noise was reduced, fuel economy was improved by 11% and NOx\r\nemissions were reduced by 60% over the previous generation. The LML is also\r\nB20 Biodiesel compatible. The heavy-duty Allison six-speed transmission boasts\r\na stronger torque converter and a larger diameter output shaft in 2011. The\r\nexhaust brake system uses the variable vane geometry turbo technology to create\r\nback pressure to slow the vehicle down. Duramax LML emissions utilizes an Exhaust\r\nGas Recirculation (EGR) with EGR cooler. The exhaust features the familiar Diesel\r\nParticulate Filter (DPF) and active regeneration approximately every 700 miles\r\n(300 fewer miles than last year). New to the LML emissions is a Selective Catalyst\r\nReduction (SCR) which utilizes Diesel Exhaust Fluid injection (DEF). This means\r\nthat LML owners will have to also keep their DEF tanks filled with a liquid\r\nsolution called &quot;urea&quot;. Fortunately, LML owners can look forward to\r\nour &quot;High Performance&quot; product line that can help squeeze out some\r\nextra horsepower and fuel economy, as well as our &quot;Race Products&quot;\r\ncapable of bypassing the restrictive emissions equipment for huge power and\r\neconomy gains.</p>",

There were few changes made to the engine in the 1994 5.9L Cummins, but there were significant developments made to the fuel system. Most notable being the introduction of the durable Bosch P7100 injection pump. The massive P7100 inline injection pump allowed for more precise control over fuel delivery, and those wanting huge power gains love the P7100 pump because modifications are simple, inexpensive and impressive. Six different fuel stop plates are available that will enable power gains from 30-150 hp and 70-300 ft-lbs of torque. Our parts inventory includes a wide variety of 12V Cummins performance parts. We can recalibrate your P7100 to make further improvements to the fuel delivery and governor settings as well. We also have performance injectors to give it that extra kick. Exhaust and intake improvements will help your 5.9L breathe easier, provide lower EGTs, increase fuel economy, and boost performance. We also have factory replacement and performance turbochargers that can handle the huge horsepower increases that the Gen II engine is capable of delivering. Our selection of 12-valve Cummins performance parts is second to none. Contact us if you can’t find the part you’re looking for. </p>\r\n",

Six different ramp designs enable power gains from 30 - 150 hp and 70 - 300 ft-lbs of torque. A calibrated boost tube orifice is included to improve turbo performance. Installation of the Stop Plate is fairly simple, but it does require partial dis-assembly of fuel pump. </p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Looking for some major horsepower increases? You found it! At\r\nleast 20 engineers were involved in designing the Fuel Stop Plate and Governor\r\ncontrols. The fuel stop plate controls the fuel quantity of the P7100\r\nfuel injection pump that is the heart of the Cummins engine performance. The Governor\r\ncontrols the engine response to load and the maximum engine rpm <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe recommend this kit be installed by a qualified installer.

    "description": " \r\n<p align=\"left\"><b>• 1998 - 2002 Dodge 5.9L 24V Cummins ISB<br>\r\n  • Generation 2, Inline 6-cylinder, 4-stroke, 24 Valve<br>\r\n  • 235-245 HP, 460-505 lbs-ft torque </b></p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">By the late '90's, vehicle manufacturers were required to produce \r\n  engines that met stricter emissions requirements than ever before. Cummins answered \r\n  that call in late 1998 with the Gen II, 24-Valve 5.9L ISB (Intellect System \r\n  B) engine in the Dodge Ram. The electronically controlled Bosch VP44 injection \r\n  pump was a state of the art fuel delivery system that pushed the 5.9L 24-Valve \r\n  engine to 215-235 hp. Problems with the weak factory fuel supply pump are common \r\n  and can destroy the VP44 injection pump. Fortunately, we can help you solve \r\n  this issue with a FASS or Airdog fuel pump. A High Output (HO) 245 HP version \r\n  was released in 2001, and the 2002 HO model was capable of producing an impressive \r\n  305 hp from the factory. Electronic tuning opened up a whole new world for performance \r\n  enthusiasts. A variety of electronic tuners are available that can easily coax \r\n  an additional 100 hp out of your 5.9L ISB engine. An added benefit to electronic \r\n  performance tuning is that increases in fuel economy can also be enjoyed. Throw \r\n  in a cold-air intake kit, a performance exhaust system, and you've got yourself \r\n  a real beast that is getting better fuel economy than it did when it left the \r\n  dealership. Factory replacement or performance turbochargers are also available. \r\n</p>\r\n",

This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>\r\n",

Symptoms of air/vapor can be low horsepower, poor fuel mileage, excessive smoke, injector failure, hard starting, surging and rough running.

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

That's\r\nright, stock automatic transmissions are designed to slip into gear for a smooth\r\ndriving experience. This slipping will cause premature torque converter failure,\r\nloss of horsepower, and loss of fuel economy. Our Performance torque converters\r\nare designed to maximize your power distribution to the ground. The BD and Banks\r\nconverters double the amount of lock up clutch material of a stock unit. BD\r\nfurnace brazes the turbine and impellor fins to prevent internal leakage, turbine\r\nand lock up piston are balanced separately and then as a complete assembly.\r\nSo basically on the street, you'll notice a more positive engagement in drive,\r\nenhanced low-speed drivability, less engine rpm and better fuel economy. </div>",

    "description": "<p align=\"left\">The Bosch Dodge VP44 diesel injection pump for 1998.5 - 2002 Dodge \r\n  5.9L Cummins 24V is a workhorse of a pump, but they are prone to a few problems. \r\n  If you are experiencing intermittent hard starting and white smoke, then there \r\n  may be an electrical problem with the Electronic Diesel Control unit (EDC) module \r\n  on top of the pump which is caused by heat and vibration. The EDC cannot be \r\n  replaced, so an EDC failure will require pump replacement. Also, severe internal \r\n  pump damage can occur if fuel supply pressure drops to 5psi or lower, especially \r\n  under heavy loads or high rpm's. When this happens, you may notice low power \r\n  or it may seem like the engine won't rev up the way it should. Eventually the \r\n  diaphragm in the front of the VP44 will rupture. This results excessive vibration \r\n  of the timing piston which then causes damage to the front cover of the injection \r\n  pump. (DTC #P0216) Also, the head &amp; rotor in the pump may seize resulting \r\n  in a &quot;no start&quot; condition. Dodge acknowledged this issue by replacing \r\n  the supply pump on the the engine with a tank mounted supply pump. This is a \r\n  costly replacement for below average results, especially if you have made any \r\n  performance modifications such as a tuner or hi-performance injectors. The best \r\n  way to deal with this problem is by replacing the factory fuel supply pump with \r\n  an AirDog or FASS supply pump such as a FASS DDRP for stock engines, or a FASS \r\n  Titanium for modified engines. A FASS system will supply constant pressure under \r\n  any load to the injection pump, virtually eliminating VP44 damage due to low \r\n  fuel pressure.</p>\r\n",

Cummins introduced the 325 \r\n  hp &quot;600&quot; series engine midway through 2004 (identifiable by a red \r\n  or silver tag on the drivers side of the engine that shows the torque rating \r\n  at &quot;600&quot;). The &quot;610&quot; model was released in 2005, and was \r\n  capable of an impressive 325 hp and 610 lb-ft of torque. The 5.9L Cummins 610 \r\n  remained unchanged through 2006 and the early 2007 5.9L models. These were the \r\n  first Cummins 5.9L 24-Valve engine to feature the Bosch Common Rail injection \r\n  system which gets it's steady supply of fuel from a CP3 high pressure supply \r\n  pump. This new technology doesn't come at a cheap price, and that's why we always \r\n  recommend a FASS system to protect your investment. A variety of electronic \r\n  tuners are available that can easily squeeze an additional 100 hp out of your \r\n  5.9L engine. An added benefit to electronic performance tuning is that increases \r\n  in fuel economy can also be enjoyed. Throw in a cold-air intake kit, a performance \r\n  exhaust system, and you've got yourself a real beast that is getting better \r\n  fuel economy than it did when it left the dealership. Factory replacement or \r\n  performance turbochargers are also available</div>",

This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>\r\n",

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

US Diesel Parts is home to the best inventory of diesel truck parts on the market.  \r\n<p align=\"left\"><b>• 2007.5 - 2018 Dodge 6.7L Cummins HPCR (High Pressure Common \r\n  Rail) <br>\r\n  • Generation 3 and 4, Inline 6-cylinder, 4-stroke, 24 Valve<br>\r\n  • 350-385 HP, 650-850 lbs-ft torque </b></p>\r\n<div align=\"left\"> \r\n  <p align=\"left\">In late 2007, Cummins bumped the displacement from 5.9L up to a healthy 6.7L engine. The '08-'12 6.7L engine cranks out 350 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque, and 2013-up puts out 385hp right off the showroom floor. The power is put to a Mercedes G56 6-spd manual transmission, or a Chrysler 6-spd 68RFE automatic transmission. Thanks to changes in the common rail fuel system, the engine runs noticeably quieter. 2007 also marked the year that Dodge introduced the diesel particulate filter (DPF), an Exhaust Gas Recirculation system (EGR) and a Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT) to assist with meeting strict emissions regulations. Unfortunately, sacrifices to power and fuel economy are made in the process of meeting emissions. We can help you recover some MPGs and power from your 6.7L engine with a variety of 6.7L Cummins performance aftermarket products. If you don’t see the 6.7L Cummins performance part that you’re looking for, contact us for assistance.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Founded in England in 1983, Superchips was one of the first companies to specialize in tuning vehicles with computer controlled fuel-injection systems. While Superchips originally focused on serving the British racing community with high-end solutions, the Company eventually began to provide power to performance enthusiasts throughout the world. Now, Superchips sells tens of thousands of hand-held programmers per year from its headquarters in Ogden, Utah.  In 2005, Superchips was acquired by MSD Performance. In 2011 Superchips became part of Powerteq LLC, which today owns and manages the Edge Products and Diablosport brands – two of the most popular performance tuning brands in North America.  In 2015, Powerteq LLC, along with the other MSD Performance Group brands, was acquired by the Holley Performance Group.  The deep line of Holley brands marries tremendous technology with cutting-edge resources and industry roots. The combination of talented personnel at Powerteq and the resources of Holley Performance Group ensure that exciting aftermarket products will launch from Superchips for many years to come.",

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

    "description": "We carry Ford Power Stroke parts for a variety of Ford models dating back to 1983. Ford entered into the light truck diesel market in the early 80's with their Navistar 6.9L and 7.3L IDI naturally aspirated V8 engines which were a huge success for Ford. In 1994 they released the 210 hp Navistar 7.3L Power Stroke engine. Navistar utilized an advanced Hydraulically Activated, Electronically Controlled Unit Injector, or \"HEUI\" for short. Although this unique fuel system seemed years ahead of its time, it had already been proven in the heavy truck market by the time Ford got their hands on it. In 1999, the 7.3L received an intercooler and changes were made to the turbo and injectors. In 2001, we saw power increase to 250-275 hp. The first major modifications to the Ford Power Stroke were made in 2003 with the arrival of the 325 hp 6.0L Power Stroke, and the 7.3L was officially discontinued in 2004. A Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT), Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) and Overhead Valves (OHV) were utilized on the new 6.0L to keep up with emissions demands. 2008 saw the arrival of the 350 hp 6.4L Twin-Turbo Common Rail engine. Advanced emissions make it one of the cleanest running diesel engines ever produced, but owners still report poor fuel mileage. We offer Power Stroke diesel parts that can improve your vehicle’s performance. In 2011 Ford introduced the 6.7L \"Scorpion\" which is the first Power Stroke engine to utilize the Bosch Common Rail injection system. Check out our inventory of Ford Power Stroke parts today to see if we have what you’re looking for.",

    "description": "<p style=\"text-align: left\">Ford introduced the first 6.9L diesel engine for their light duty trucks in 1983. The naturally aspirated, indirect injection (IDI) engine featured a Stanadyne DB2 injection pump, and put out a very respectable 170 horsepower for the day. The 6.9L was bored out to 7.3L in 1987. The original 7.3L diesel was a non-turbo charged IDI engine. It was followed shortly after by a turbocharged version, but otherwise remained basically the same throughout 1993. We have been working with these engines since their introduction and can help you with everything from glow plugs to a complete re-manufactured engine. If you're looking for a replacement injection pump or injectors, then you have come to the right place. There are very few performance modifications available for the 6.9L and 7.3L IDI engines. But if you're a dedicated 6.9L or 7.3L IDI owner, then check out our Banks Sidewinder Performance Packages. As always, if you don't see what you came here looking for, then please give us a call so that we can help you find it.</p>",

Those are included in the pump installation kit that can also be found on this page. The heater\r\n    o-ring located at the top of the filter assembly is also prone to leaking. You can purchase the heater o-ring (p/n E8TZ-9K342-A) or the entire heater (p/n\r\nF2TZ-9J294-A) from your local Ford dealer.

The first 7.3L Power Stroke produced 250 hp and 525 lb-ft of torque. The heart of the new design was a &quot;single shot&quot; HEUI (hydraulic electronic unit injector) fuel injection system that ran a 15&deg; high pressure oil pump (HPOP) to create fuel injection pressures. The 1994 - 1997 7.3L Power Strokes are still hugely popular and there is an abundance of aftermarket performance options to choose from. Cold air intake kits and performance exhaust systems will get you a few extra ponies while lowering EGT's and increasing fuel economy. A performance tuner can offer some serious hp gains and also help increase your fuel mileage. Factory and hi-performance turbochargers are also available. We also have everything from high pressure oil pumps, glow plugs and filters to keep your Power Stroke on the road.

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

    "description": "<p align=\"left\">US Diesel Parts is home to a great variety of 7.3L Power Stroke performance parts and stock parts for 1998-2003 models. There were a few notable changes made to the 7.3L Power Stroke in 1999. An intercooler was added to cool the charged air from the turbocharger. The cooler, denser air helps increase horsepower and reduce EGTs. The turbine housing was changed to a .84 A/R and a wastegate was also added. The single shot HEUI injectors were changed to split shot design, and the high-pressure oil pump was advanced to 17° to help increase the necessary fuel pressure. The 1998 7.3L PS was rated at 225 hp, and the 1999 - 2000 models were rated at 235 hp. 2001 - 2003 saw another boost to about 250-275 hp from the factory. We carry an abundance of aftermarket performance options to choose from for the 1998-2003 7.3L Power Strokes. Cold air intake kits and performance exhaust systems will get you a few extra ponies while lowering EGT's and increasing fuel economy. A performance tuner can offer some serious hp gains and also help increase your fuel mileage. Factory and hi-performance turbochargers are also available. Our inventory of stock and performance parts for 7.3L Power Stroke engines includes high-pressure oil pumps, glow plugs, filters, engine kits, fuel injectors, turbochargers, complete engines and more to keep your Power Stroke on the road. If you don't see the 7.3L Power Stroke performance parts or stock parts that you came here looking for, then just grab the phone and give us a call!</p>",

This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>\r\n",

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<p align=\"left\">EGR cooler and engine failures on the 6.0L Power Stroke can often\r\nbe traced to a chain reaction that starts with the <b>Engine Oil Cooler</b>\r\nfailure. The engine oil cooler has small narrow, flat cooling tubes that are\r\neasily clogged by foreign material in the coolant. Engine coolant flows through\r\nthe engine oil cooler first and then to the EGR cooler. So if the engine oil\r\ncooler becomes clogged, then engine oil may become overheated causing poor performance\r\nand eventually engine damage. The restricted downstream flow of coolant will\r\nalso cause coolant within the EGR cooler to flash-boil and spill coolant into\r\nthe overflow tank. Eventually the overflow tank overfills, coolant is lost and\r\nthe engine will overheat. In time, the <a href=\"index.cfm/category/833/egr-cooler-delete-kits-60l-power-stroke.cfm\">EGR\r\nCooler</a> can also become corroded under these conditions, and will leak coolant\r\ninto the engine oil.</p>",

    "description": "<p align=\"left\">Looking for replacement cylinder heads for 6.0L Power Stroke engines? The head studs on the 6.0L Power Stroke are susceptible to failures due to a number of reasons. A leaking EGR Cooler will contaminate the cylinders with coolant, causing a hydraulic effect that will stretch the head studs and cause the head gaskets to fail. Also, the head studs pass through an aluminum carrier and a cast-iron head. The aluminum and the cast iron expand and contract at different rates which can weaken the factory grade head studs and hamper their ability to do their job. Additionally, the aluminum carrier does not allow sufficient clamping force with the factory head studs to withstand the extreme pressures that the 6.0L engine produces. We carry a wide selection of replacement cylinder heads for 6.0L Power Stroke engines.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">In addition to upgrading your Engine Oil Cooler and installing an EGR Cooler Delete Kit, we recommend installing a set of ARP head studs and Black Diamond head gaskets that will not only hold up to the extreme pressures that the 6.0L engine demands, but will also withstand aftermarket turbocharger boost pressures beyond anything that your factory replacement heads studs and head gaskets can offer. Browse our selection of cylinder heads for 6.0L Power Stroke engines below.</p>",

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

The design changes to the 6.4L were made primarily to meet new\r\nemissions requirements. The 6.4L Power Stroke is a clean and quiet running engine\r\nand the first in it's class to feature factory twin turbochargers to help reduce\r\nturbo lag. The 6.4L is also the first Power Stroke engine that utilizes a Common\r\nRail injection system and a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) regenerative system\r\nthat burns off excess soot and ash. While the DPF does a good job of filtering\r\nout particulates, it has had a negative affect on fuel mileage. Fortunately,\r\nthere is an abundance of aftermarket performance options to choose from for\r\nthe 6.4L Power Strokes that will also help increase power and mileage. Cold\r\nair intake kits and performance exhaust systems will get you a few extra ponies\r\nwhile lowering EGT's and increasing fuel mileage. A performance tuner can offer\r\nsome serious hp gains and also help increase your mpg's.</p>",

This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>\r\n",

The movement of the fuel inside the tank, and the process of fuel transfer under these conditions creates as much as 10% air/vapor within the fuel. Symptoms of air/vapor can be low horsepower, poor fuel mileage, excessive smoke, injector failure, hard starting, surging and rough running.

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

    "description": "<p align=\"left\">Ford\r\ncodenamed the latest 6.7L Power Stroke engine the \"Scorpion\" due to the turbo\r\nplacement on top of the engine. The Scorpion features many groundbreaking changes\r\nin 2011, such as a compacted graphite iron (CGI) block for greater strength and\r\nreduced weight, reverse flow aluminum cylinder heads with exhaust ports located\r\nin the lifter valley, dual water jackets, six head bolts per cylinder, and\r\na 29,000 psi high-pressure Bosch Common Rail fuel system, which is a first for\r\nany Power Stroke engine. The system delivers up to five injection events per cylinder\r\nper cycle using eight-hole piezo injectors.\r\nThis 6.7L Scorpion also supports B20 biodiesel. Honeywells unique single-sequential turbocharger\r\nfeatures a double-sided compressor wheel mounted on a single shaft. It combines\r\nthe benefits of a small turbocharger for quicker response and a large turbocharger\r\nwith the ability to compress and force more air into the engine for more power\r\nall in one unit. Emission controls include exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), Denoxtronic\r\nbased Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) from Bosch, and a Diesel Particulate\r\nFilter (DPF). The new engine control software bumped the horsepower to 400 hp\r\n@ 2800 rpm and 800 lbft @ 1600 rpm. You'll find a nice selection of high performance and factory replacement parts for your Ford 6.7L Power Stroke right here!</p>",

The design featured a Turbocharger and Direct Injection fuel system by Bosch. The advanced turbocharger system increases airflow, and an intercooler lowers the intake air temperatures of the compressed air from the turbo, allowing for greater engine fuel efficiency, more power and torque and lower emissions. </p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">In 2009, a Volkswagen Passat set a fuel economy record by averaging 67.9 miles per gallon in a tour of the 48 contiguous states. More recently, a 2012 Volkswagen Passat TDI SE was driven 1,626.1 miles from Houston, TX to Sterling, Va., breaking the Guinness record for the longest drive in a passenger car on a single tank of diesel fuel. The TDI 1.9L is no slouch either. TDI owners regularly achieve up to 220+ hp to the wheels while still averaging 50 mpg's on the highway. </p>",

    "description": "Intercoolers and related parts for 1994 - 1998 Dodge 5.9L Cummins 12V.  Heat is one of the biggest threats to overall powertrain longevity. As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

This oil cooks into a carbon coating on the heated components. Eventually this carbon coating will build up and cause the\r\n    turbocharger bearings to seize. This results in turbo failure and potential engine damage.\r\n</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n    <strong>The Solution is simple:</strong>\r\n    <br/>\r\n    This can easily be solved by installing a Diesel Turbo Lifesaver (DTLS). Once the DTLS is installed, you don't have to do anything. You simply turn off the\r\n    ignition switch, remove the key and get out of your vehicle as you normally would. The DTLS takes over and automatically idles your engine and then shuts\r\n    it off once a safe turbo shut-down temperature has been reached.\r\n</p>",

    "description": "<p align=\"left\">Air/vapor in diesel fuel is a common problem with any diesel vehicle where the fuel tank is located at a lower point than the engine. The movement of the fuel inside the tank, and the process of fuel transfer under these conditions creates as much as 10% air/vapor within the fuel. Symptoms of air/vapor can be low horsepower, poor fuel mileage, excessive smoke, injector failure, hard starting, surging and rough running. You can eliminate this problem with a FASS Fuel Air Separation System and get &quot;test cell&quot; performance under real world conditions.</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<table cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" width=\"550\">\r\n<tr>\r\n     <td>\r\n<div align=\"left\">&bull; Increase Horsepower<br />\r\n&bull; Better Fuel Mileage<br />\r\n&bull; Less Smoke<br />\r\n&bull; Protects Injection System<br />\r\n&bull; Easier Starting<br />\r\n&bull; Engine Runs Smoother<br />\r\n&bull; Better Throttle Response</div>\r\n     </td>\r\n     <td>\r\n<img alt=\"FASS eliminates air/vapor in your fuel. \" width=\"200\" height=\"163\" align=\"right\" src=\"/files/images/fuel_comparison.jpg\" />\r\n     </td>\r\n     <td width=\"100\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br><br>",

GM Duramax trucks do not have a stock lift pump which forces the injection pump to \"pull\" the fuel all the way from the tank, creating a vacuum and constantly introduces more air and vapor into your fuel. The Dura-Max Flow Enhancer creates a postive flow of fuel, \"pushing\" it to your injection pump, eliminating vacuum and drastically reducing air and vapor in your fuel.",

    "description": "<p>Superchips Tuners and Programmers for 2001 - 2004 Chevy GMC 6.6L LB7 Duramax.  Superchips of Sanford, Florida is the industry leader in automotive tuning for late model cars, Jeeps and trucks. Founded in England in 1983, Superchips was one of the first companies to specialize in tuning vehicles with computer controlled fuel-injection systems. While Superchips originally focused on serving the British racing community with high-end solutions, the Company eventually began to provide power to performance enthusiasts throughout the world. Now, Superchips sells tens of thousands of hand-held programmers per year from its headquarters in Ogden, Utah.  In 2005, Superchips was acquired by MSD Performance. In 2011 Superchips became part of Powerteq LLC, which today owns and manages the Edge Products and Diablosport brands – two of the most popular performance tuning brands in North America.  In 2015, Powerteq LLC, along with the other MSD Performance Group brands, was acquired by the Holley Performance Group.  The deep line of Holley brands marries tremendous technology with cutting-edge resources and industry roots. The combination of talented personnel at Powerteq and the resources of Holley Performance Group ensure that exciting aftermarket products will launch from Superchips for many years to come.</p>",

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

Superchips of Sanford, Florida is the industry leader in automotive tuning for late model cars, Jeeps and trucks. Founded in England in 1983, Superchips was one of the first companies to specialize in tuning vehicles with computer controlled fuel-injection systems. While Superchips originally focused on serving the British racing community with high-end solutions, the Company eventually began to provide power to performance enthusiasts throughout the world. Now, Superchips sells tens of thousands of hand-held programmers per year from its headquarters in Ogden, Utah.  In 2005, Superchips was acquired by MSD Performance. In 2011 Superchips became part of Powerteq LLC, which today owns and manages the Edge Products and Diablosport brands – two of the most popular performance tuning brands in North America.  In 2015, Powerteq LLC, along with the other MSD Performance Group brands, was acquired by the Holley Performance Group.  The deep line of Holley brands marries tremendous technology with cutting-edge resources and industry roots. The combination of talented personnel at Powerteq and the resources of Holley Performance Group ensure that exciting aftermarket products will launch from Superchips for many years to come.</p>",

This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>\r\n",

Clean fuel is very important, \r\n    so changing your fuel filters at the recommended intervals is critical.

So when you start adding power modules, turbo \r\n  upgrades and other bolt-ons, it’s only a matter of time before the transmission \r\n  wears out and eventually fails. \r\n<p align=\"left\">BD transmissions are built specifically to handle the high torque \r\n  loads of the Cummins diesel engines. The valve body is programmed for higher \r\n  line pressure. Heavy-duty clutches with up to 25% more material than stock are \r\n  installed. The stock thrust washers, which disintegrate and leave metal filings \r\n  in your transmission, are replaced with roller Torrington bearings. New input \r\n  shafts and hubs are installed to eliminate possible metal fatigue or high torque \r\n  load damage from prior use. The early 47RE transmissions are upgraded with more \r\n  rugged 48RE components. We recommend billet steel input and output shafts for \r\n  applications with extra big tires and modified power levels.\r\n",

Today the P7100 is still extremely popular with Dodge enthusiasts. Whether it's for sled pulling, drag racing or just everyday driving, the 1994 - 1998 Dodge 5.9L Cummins 12V diesel has proven to be a true workhorse. We've been rebuilding the P7100 pump since it's introduction, and we're still building them today. Our technicians are factory trained and certified, and they know what they're doing when it comes to dialing these P7100 injection pumps in for maximum performance and economy. We offer a 1-Year limited warranty on all High Performance and Stock OEM P7100 injection pumps. We also carry a complete line of performance accessories for the P7100 such as fuel plates and governor spring kits.

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

Why can't someone just build a better lift pump that just mounts in the stock in-tank location? Well, that time has come, introducing the PowerFlo Lift Pump from Fleece Performance Engineering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No more noisy lift pumps, cutting holes in your fuel tank, or quarter tank issues. Fleece's drop-in lift pump allows for silent operation, utilizes the factory connections for an easy installation and its active fill bucket technology eliminates the need for a draw straw or tank sump. The PowerFlo Lift Pump operates with two OEM quality gerotor pumps that have surpassed 12,000 hours of durability testing and together flow 170 GPH @ 15 psi, making the PowerFlo Lift Pump capable of supporting 800+ RWHP.</p>",

The 48RE transmissions were really designed for about 570 lb-ft of torque from the factory. Meanwhile, the standard Cummins in this year range has peaked at 610 lb-ft from the factory. The limits of the 48RE transmission are quickly understood especially when performance modifications have been added to the vehicle.  Randy’s Transmissions understand the limits of the 48RE and really knows what it takes to make a reliable 48RE hold up to whatever the end user is doing with their Dodge Cummins pickup. Randy has spent 1,000’s of hours building, designing, and breaking transmissions to gain the knowledge and understanding what it takes to build a 48RE to the level you need. That’s why Randy’s transmissions have more new replacement parts than any other remanufacture in the industry. Browse our Dodge Cummins 48RE transmission line-up by Randy’s Transmission and if you have any question please feel free to contact us and we will gladly help you decide what Randy’s transmission would be best fit for your needs.</p>",

On the 2nd Gen trucks the turbocharger is mounted on the middle of the exhaust manifold while the 3rd and 4th gen is located at the back. In theory, the exhaust pulse in the central location is much more efficient for turbo spool. This location is much easier to get to and makes future modifications a lot easier. Not only being less restrictive than the stock 3rd and 4th Gen manifold, you will be installing a more reliable NON-VGT turbocharger in place of the stock unit.

    "description": "If you do not know already, Duramax trucks do not come with any lift pump supplying fuel to the injection pump. This added stress on the fuel system can create poor mileage and low power especially under a loaded situation. The factory CP4 injection pumps are substantially weaker than that of the previous model years CP3. Not having a steady reliable flow of fuel will increase the risk of the CP4 failing. Adding this pump from Fleece will drastically reduce the chance of CP4 failure. Also, any time a tuner is added to these trucks, more fuel is demanded out of the injection pump and if there is no fuel supplying that pump, you are loosing power! Adding a lift pump system to your LML will help improve overall efficiency and mileage. They are however absolutely necessary for anyone that wants to make power on these trucks. Until now, the only options were frame mounted pumps that look out of place on your LML Duramax. No more noisy lift pumps, cutting holes in your fuel tank, or quarter tank issues. Fleece's drop-in lift pump allows for silent operation, utilizes the factory connections for an easy installation and its active fill bucket technology eliminates the need for a draw straw or tank sump. The PowerFlo Lift Pump operates with two OEM quality gerotor pumps that have surpassed 12,000 hours of durability testing and together flow 170 GPH @ 15 psi, making the PowerFlo Lift Pump capable of supporting 800+ RWHP. Fleece also offers performance SureFlo sending units using their baffled fuel bucket to be used with an aftermarket fuel pump.",

However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.",

It can be an easy decision at first to change out your turbocharger for a performance turbo.  This is where most encounter their first wall in doing so.  The diesel performance world has so many options that it quickly becomes very difficult on choosing what turbo is right for you.  You can search the web, ask your buddies, check out forums and by the end of the day, you most likely still will be confused and settle back on buying a stock turbocharger.  Don't do it!  We're not being cliche' when we say \"Let the pro's help\" because we really can help make the best decision for your vehicles turbocharger needs.  At the same time we're also not trying to sell you the biggest and most bad-ass turbo you can afford when a more refined solution will perform better.  Let us explain below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\r\n    font-weight: 900;\r\n    color: #005eaf;\r\n    text-transform: uppercase;\r\n    line-height: normal;\r\n    text-shadow: 0px 4px 4px #c7c3c3;\"><b>Most people are looking for an upgraded turbocharger for two basic reasons:</b><br />They want better pulling power -and/or- Their stock turbo has failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people want to go as big as they can, and we can help if that's what you're looking for, but for the most part we've found the majority may only need a simple stage 1 upgrade to give them that extra pulling power and performance they're looking for.  You can quickly find yourself having to build around a large turbocharger ~ often to get the same performance you could have gotten from a smaller turbo without the problems or extra costs associated with doing so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We've been installing upgraded turbos for well over two decades and feel we have enough experience to put our customers into a turbocharger that fits their needs. To do this, and help clear up the confusion, we put together a selection of  turbochargers below that are simple, straight forward to install, that may only require a small amount of extra fueling to perform.  These turbos are excellent in quality, have been proven to perform, and are designed to run with your emissions intact. Anytime you upgrade to a larger turbo you will have more turbo lag. Turbo lag is the response time it takes for the turbo to spool up. The more turbo lag you have, the more smoke and less drive-ability you will have. We recommend a tuner to help that turbo spool up quicker so you will have less smoke, lower EGT’s, and make the drive more enjoyable.  If you don’t have a tuner already and need help on choosing the best one that fits your needs or if you want more options on the turbo’s please feel free to call us.</p>",

    "description": "If you do not know already, Duramax trucks do not come with any lift pump supplying fuel to the injection pump. This added stress on the fuel system can create poor mileage and low power especially under a loaded situation. The factory CP4 injection pumps are substantially weaker than that of the previous model years CP3. Not having a steady reliable flow of fuel will increase the risk of the CP4 failing. Adding this pump from Fleece will drastically reduce the chance of CP4 failure. Also, any time a tuner is added to these trucks, more fuel is demanded out of the injection pump and if there is no fuel supplying that pump, you are loosing power! Adding a lift pump system to your LML will help improve overall efficiency and mileage. They are however absolutely necessary for anyone that wants to make power on these trucks. Until now, the only options were frame mounted pumps that look out of place on your LML Duramax. No more noisy lift pumps, cutting holes in your fuel tank, or quarter tank issues. Fleece's drop-in lift pump allows for silent operation, utilizes the factory connections for an easy installation and its active fill bucket technology eliminates the need for a draw straw or tank sump. The PowerFlo Lift Pump operates with two OEM quality gerotor pumps that have surpassed 12,000 hours of durability testing and together flow 170 GPH @ 15 psi, making the PowerFlo Lift Pump capable of supporting 800+ RWHP. Fleece also offers performance SureFlo sending units using their baffled fuel bucket to be used with an aftermarket fuel pump.",

The 2008-2012 6.7L engine cranks out 350 hp and 650 ft-lbs of torque, 2013-2018 puts out 385hp with close to 900 ft-lbs of torque, and the 2019+ running 400+ HP with 1000 ft-lbs of torque! The power is put to a Mercedes G56 6-spd manual transmission, or a Chrysler 6-spd 68RFE automatic transmission. Thanks to changes in the common rail fuel system, the engine runs noticeably quieter. 2007 also marked the year that Dodge introduced the diesel particulate filter (DPF), an Exhaust Gas Recirculation system (EGR) and a Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT) to assist with meeting strict emissions regulations. Unfortunately, sacrifices to power and fuel economy are made in the process of meeting emissions. We can help you recover some MPGs and power from your 6.7L engine with a variety of 6.7L Cummins performance aftermarket products.

Without the proper lubricity additive, the pump runs very hot and wear much faster than normal leading to a complete failure that typically ends with the pump contaminating the full fuel system with metal debris.  When this happens, the only recourse is a complete fuel system replacement including fuel lines, filters, injectors, fuel rail and connector tubes.  A huge cost that could have be prevented.  If you decide to keep running the stock CP4, please invest in using a lubricity additive.  Otherwise, a CP3 conversion kit is what we would advise.  The CP3 pump is a tried and true design that, while not failure proof, have shown they are a work-horse since the late 90's.  The CP3 pump is also much easier to upgrade to a performance version when fueling over stock is a must to keep up with aftermarket injectors and turbochargers.</p>",
