They have come a long way since then, and we've worked hard to keep in step with the advancing technology. We still rebuild the Bosch VE6 injection pumps and injectors from the 89-93 models, the 94-98 12-valve P7100 injection pumps, and also provide quality VP44 injection pumps and CP3 pumps and common rail injectors. When it comes to turbochargers, we can set you up with a factory replacement or get you upgraded with something that will handle your performance modifications. We also have a great selection of tuners, intake kits and exhaust systems that will not only get you some more power, but also help your fuel economy out. We offer a great selection of brand name products at guaranteed low prices. Trust US Diesel Parts to provide the best Dodge diesel performance parts for your truck.

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

The head studs on the 6.0L Power Stroke are susceptible to failures due to a number of reasons. A leaking EGR Cooler will contaminate the cylinders with coolant, causing a hydraulic effect that will stretch the head studs and cause the head gaskets to fail. Also, the head studs pass through an aluminum carrier and a cast-iron head. The aluminum and the cast iron expand and contract at different rates which can weaken the factory grade head studs and hamper their ability to do their job. Additionally, the aluminum carrier does not allow sufficient clamping force with the factory head studs to withstand the extreme pressures that the 6.0L engine produces. We carry a wide selection of replacement cylinder heads for 6.0L Power Stroke engines.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">In addition to upgrading your Engine Oil Cooler and installing an EGR Cooler Delete Kit, we recommend installing a set of ARP head studs and Black Diamond head gaskets that will not only hold up to the extreme pressures that the 6.0L engine demands, but will also withstand aftermarket turbocharger boost pressures beyond anything that your factory replacement heads studs and head gaskets can offer.

The Scorpion features many groundbreaking changes\r\nin 2011, such as a compacted graphite iron (CGI) block for greater strength and\r\nreduced weight, reverse flow aluminum cylinder heads with exhaust ports located\r\nin the lifter valley, dual water jackets, six head bolts per cylinder, and\r\na 29,000 psi high-pressure Bosch Common Rail fuel system, which is a first for\r\nany Power Stroke engine. The system delivers up to five injection events per cylinder\r\nper cycle using eight-hole piezo injectors.\r\nThis 6.7L Scorpion also supports B20 biodiesel. Honeywells unique single-sequential turbocharger\r\nfeatures a double-sided compressor wheel mounted on a single shaft. It combines\r\nthe benefits of a small turbocharger for quicker response and a large turbocharger\r\nwith the ability to compress and force more air into the engine for more power\r\nall in one unit. Emission controls include exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), Denoxtronic\r\nbased Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) from Bosch, and a Diesel Particulate\r\nFilter (DPF). The new engine control software bumped the horsepower to 400 hp\r\n@ 2800 rpm and 800 lbft @ 1600 rpm.

This oil cooks into a carbon coating on the heated components. Eventually this carbon coating will build up and cause the\r\n    turbocharger bearings to seize.

So when you start adding power modules, turbo \r\n  upgrades and other bolt-ons, it’s only a matter of time before the transmission \r\n  wears out and eventually fails. \r\n<p align=\"left\">BD transmissions are built specifically to handle the high torque \r\n  loads of the Cummins diesel engines. The valve body is programmed for higher \r\n  line pressure. Heavy-duty clutches with up to 25% more material than stock are \r\n  installed. The stock thrust washers, which disintegrate and leave metal filings \r\n  in your transmission, are replaced with roller Torrington bearings. New input \r\n  shafts and hubs are installed to eliminate possible metal fatigue or high torque \r\n  load damage from prior use. The early 47RE transmissions are upgraded with more \r\n  rugged 48RE components. We recommend billet steel input and output shafts for \r\n  applications with extra big tires and modified power levels.\r\n",

This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.

For the truck lift and suspension side of things, we've seen small companies become industry giants and others fade into obscurity.  We would like to think we've gotten a pretty good feel for who to go with and stake our reputation on by how these manufacturers do business, treat us, and treat our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This would be why we partner with BDS Suspension, Zone Offroad and FOX Racing Equipment.  They've proven themselves to be some of the best at what they do and how they do it.  Quality products, time and again, with warranties that prove they stand behind their merchandise 100%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us customize and install a performance suspension upgrade for your truck, or if you aren't local, you can still get the best deal around on kits for installation elsewhere!</p>",

The 2008-2012 6.7L engine cranks out 350 hp and 650 ft-lbs of torque, 2013-2018 puts out 385hp with close to 900 ft-lbs of torque, and the 2019+ running 400+ HP with 1000 ft-lbs of torque! The power is put to a Mercedes G56 6-spd manual transmission, or a Chrysler 6-spd 68RFE automatic transmission. Thanks to changes in the common rail fuel system, the engine runs noticeably quieter. 2007 also marked the year that Dodge introduced the diesel particulate filter (DPF), an Exhaust Gas Recirculation system (EGR) and a Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT) to assist with meeting strict emissions regulations. Unfortunately, sacrifices to power and fuel economy are made in the process of meeting emissions. We can help you recover some MPGs and power from your 6.7L engine with a variety of 6.7L Cummins performance aftermarket products. If you don’t see the 6.7L Cummins performance part that you’re looking for, contact us for assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n",

Without the proper lubricity additive, the pump runs very hot and wear much faster than normal leading to a complete failure that typically ends with the pump contaminating the full fuel system with metal debris.  When this happens, the only recourse is a complete fuel system replacement including fuel lines, filters, injectors, fuel rail and connector tubes.  A huge cost that could have be prevented.  If you decide to keep running the stock CP4, please invest in using a lubricity additive.  Otherwise, a CP3 conversion kit is what we would advise.  The CP3 pump is a tried and true design that, while not failure proof, have shown they are a work-horse since the late 90's.  The CP3 pump is also much easier to upgrade to a performance version when fueling over stock is a must to keep up with aftermarket injectors and turbochargers.</p>",

This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways. By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder. This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response. Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work. In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear. A true win-win-win situation.</p>\r\n",
