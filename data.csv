<h1 itemprop=""name"" class=""wsm-prod-title"">What is a “Reman” Engine?</h1>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-12"">
<p>Arguably the absolute worst thing that can happen to a vehicle is something catastrophic happening with its engine. It’s almost defeating when your vehicle experiences engine troubles and the prognosis is more than just grim—it’s an ultimatum. Either you need to rebuild your engine, replace it, or find a new vehicle entirely. In these unfortunate circumstances, you would probably consider just getting rid of the vehicle in and of itself to save yourself the hassle of replacing the engine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-12"">
<p>But what if saving your vehicle could be hassle-free and leave it functioning, factory-fresh and good as new?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-12"">
<p>Don’t send your car to the junkyard just yet. Consider a “reman” engine, which can give you longevity and quality for a lower price than a fully rebuilt or brand-new engine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-12"">
<p>Now, you may be wondering, what is a reman engine anyway? Well, “reman” is just short for “remanufactured!” A remanufactured engine is an engine that is restored using old parts in combination with new or re-machined parts, in order to give you an engine that is as close to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) expectations without carrying the cost that comes with an entirely new engine. Think of it like recycling, but for your engine!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-12"">
<p>A remanufactured engine starts by taking the core of an engine that is unharmed and cleaning it, then replacing any smaller parts and reconditioning any bigger parts to the best of a remanufacturer’s ability. Any part that is damaged or worn will be replaced with new parts, and the process will leave your engine as good as, or better than, the day it hit the road.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-12"">
<p>Keep in mind, however, that remanufactured engines require the proper parts to communicate with the computer of your vehicle. It is of paramount importance to have this information, or ensure that the mechanic or garage making your engine has this information, before ordering a remanufactured engine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-12"">
<p>As long as your remanufactured engine is manufactured by a trusted garage or mechanic, you can rest assured knowing that the quality of your engine will be at its peak. A trustworthy remanufactured engine will also likely come with a one-year warranty, so any issues that arise within that year can be solved by the very people who gave the engine to you.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>As vehicles become much more easily customizable in order to suit them to their user’s needs, the tools necessary to create these customizations have become more commonly known. For diesel vehicles, there are two tools in existence that can help you create the most optimized, personalized experience: the tuner and the programmer.</p>
<br/>
<p>When you’re presented with two options to change up the functionality of your vehicle, it’s only natural to wonder if any difference exists between them. In this article, we will be answering the all too common question of diesel engine vehicle owners, “what is the difference between a tuner and a programmer?”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-12"">
<p>The answer to this question is simple. <i>There is almost none</i>. The terms “tuner” and “programmer” are almost always used interchangeably, as they essentially do the same thing in the same way. They can both greatly enhance the power of your vehicle, and they both communicate with the computer in your vehicle to allow these enhancements to occur. They alter the computer system in order to maximize the performance of your vehicle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-6"">
<p>The installation of tuner parts and programmer parts is easy and allows for not only an incredible increase in power, but it also makes your diesel vehicle more fuel-efficient. The ability of tuners and programmers to increase your engine’s horsepower makes them an invaluable investment for anyone looking to give their vehicle an extra push.</p>
<br/>
<p>One thing that can set tuners and programmers apart is the ability to customize certain settings on your vehicle’s computer system. For example, some tuners can allow you to adjust your speed limiter, while programmers can display diagnostic codes and monitor engine function. All of this, however, is ultimately unnecessary. It’s up to you, the consumer, to decide whether that is something you deem important. 
</p>

<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-12"">
<p>If one thing is for certain, it’s that tuners and programmers are both an investment that can make your vehicle a whole lot smoother, more powerful, and more cost-effective. The ability to see diagnostic codes and deal with them on your own, or to directly access issues with your vehicle or its computer, can help you cut down on maintenance costs while ensuring that the quality of your vehicle stays at its absolute highest. You are in full control when you use a tuner or programmer.</p>

        <p>Consider any vehicle of any kind. What's the first thing that comes to mind as being the most integral part of that vehicle’s function? It is almost undeniable that everyone’s first thought is the engine. An engine cannot run without fuel, and fuel can’t run an engine unless it has a functional fuel injection pump.</p>
        <p>A fuel injection pump is almost exactly what it sounds like: a pump that injects fuel into an engine. However, what is not evident from the name is that the CP4 fuel injection pump uses pistons and a plunger to move diesel into the fuel system’s common rail and injectors at an incredibly high pressure (sometimes up to 30,000 psi!). This gear-driven pump uses less volume than previous versions, and creates more pressure. This makes it more desirable than previous versions, or other kinds of fuel injection pump systems.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
    <div class=""col-12"">
        <p>Unfortunately, the CP4 has its cons as well. Above anything else, the CP4 has a tendency to fail around the 100,000 mile mark at a greater rate than normal. Some sources state that the failure rate of the CP4 is anywhere from 5% to 7%. It's unfortunate that this revolutionary injection pump system has a high failure rate. But it’s also important to know. When you know about the CP4’s tendency to fail, you can learn the signs and common causes of failure so you can prevent it.</p>
        <p>CP4 pump failure is most due to a lack of lubrication in the pump. The lubrication in a fuel injection pump allows for less friction. A more lubricated pump causes less erosion of the metal. With a lack of lubrication, metal shavings caused by erosion can begin distributing throughout the entire fuel system. This renders the entire thing useless, and can lead to catastrophic failure.</p>
        <p>Even if your engine simply stops working, the failure of a CP4 pump due to metal erosion is not an easy fix. The debris won’t only ruin your injector pump, but it will affect your entire fuel system. If your vehicle is out of warranty, that fix can cost upwards of $10k.</p>
        <p>So, how can you avoid CP4 failure? First, it’s important to take precautions. One example is being mindful about what fuel you’re putting in your engine. More reputable, higher-grade diesel fuels are best for CP4 pumps. You can also try using additive lubricant. This ensures that your fuel pumps are always properly lubricated. It may also be worthwhile to invest in a filter for your system that can protect the fuel flow from metal shavings and other contaminants.</p>
        <p>The CP4 is a great fuel injection pump, but it comes with its own unique set of drawbacks. Looking for CP4 parts, additives, or more information about fuel injection pumps?

          <p>The CP4 fuel injection pump is an incredibly state-of-the-art fuel system that allows for peak performance with high-pressure, cutting-edge technology. However, just because today’s diesel engines equipped with these are more lightweight, efficient, and effective doesn’t mean that they are without flaws. </p>
          <p>These systems use unprecedentedly high pressures to employ less fuel volume, saving money and attracting users. But they do have one major design flaw, which lies in the necessity of their lubrication. An unlubricated CP4 fuel injection pump can lead to roller lifter failure in the high pressure pump, which effectively causes the pump to wear itself down until its ultimate demise. The roller lifter will destroy itself by hitting against the side of the pump, sending metal shavings into the fuel system as a whole and causing irreparable damage.</p>
     </div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
     <div class=""col-12"">
          <p>One of the worst parts about this is that a driver likely won’t notice that anything is even wrong until it’s too late to fix the problem. Once the roller lifter fails, it is essentially incapable of being fixed, and removing the metal residue all throughout the fuel system is not a cheap fix. It almost always requires a complete replacement of the fuel system, which can easily run you up to $10,000 if you’re without warranty.</p>
          <p>Enter the CP4 fuel bypass kit, otherwise known as the CP4 disaster prevention kit. Installing this kit on your CP4 fuel injection pump can avoid the onset of otherwise catastrophic problems with your fuel system. Of course, a fuel bypass kit is relatively costly, but even costlier is replacing an entire fuel system; the CP4 bypass kit will be the better option any day, and you won’t have to repair your vehicle after what can be a tragic failure.</p>
          <p>But how exactly does this kit work?</p>
          <p>In short, the CP4 bypass kit works by keeping the fuel centralized rather than pumping it throughout the whole system. A CP4 fuel bypass kit takes the fuel pumping out of the bottom of the pump and sends it right back into the fuel tank and filters, which removes the risk of any possible debris getting into the rest of the fuel system. The fuel system failure as a result of a CP4 fuel injection pump is thereby prevented, keeping the rest of your system out of harm’s way and ensuring your engine is protected.</p>
          <p>This CP4 bypass kit is nothing less than a stroke of genius.

<div class=""row"">
     <div class=""col-12"">
          <p>When you’re running a diesel engine, it is important to know about the parts within it to be able to diagnose and treat any problems that come your way. One of the most essential parts of a diesel engine is the fuel injector control module, or FICM. This piece’s job is one of the most important parts of ensuring the quality and longevity of your engine and, in turn, your vehicle. This article will give you insight into how you can know if you have a damaged FICM.</p>
          <p>The FICM is absolutely necessary for any diesel engine. This module controls the electrical supply that opens and closes the fuel injectors in your engine. It sends a 48-volt pulse to the injector coil, which allows the spool valve to open and activates the fuel side of the injector using the highly pressurized oil in the engine. A diesel engine runs on a specialized, pressurized flow of fuel and air. These high pressure conditions would cause many systems to fail immediately, but the FICM avoids that. Because of the fuel injector control module, you will instead receive the highest level of performance and efficiency from your diesel engine.</p>
          <p>In simple words, the FICM is what makes your engine run, and a bad FICM can render your engine useless until any problems with it are rectified. Luckily, there are physical signs of a bad FICM, and while these may be inconvenient, they can help you fix something that would become a much bigger issue otherwise.</p>
          <p>The major signs of a damaged FICM are hard starting or failing to start, rough running, lower power, and a greater than normal amount of exhaust releasing from the tailpipe. It is important to note that, while these symptoms can always exist, they can worsen significantly when the weather is colder. If the engine is hard to start on a warm day, it will almost certainly be more difficult on a cold one. If your vehicle cranks upon starting or refuses to start, drives worse, or emits larger-than-normal puffs of smoke, it is likely that a bad FICM is to blame.</p>
          <p>Arguably the most prominent cause of bad FICMs is a low battery voltage. You need to ensure that your battery is charging, and if it doesn’t hold a charge, it needs to be replaced. The battery voltage matters in this situation because a low battery voltage can cause the current reaching the FICM to increase, damaging its circuitry. These issues can also be related to a FICM power supply side failure, in which the power to the injectors is not adequate to start or run the engine. Regardless, there are luckily easy ways to fix a faulty FICM.</p>
          <p>A bad FICM can be fixed through a few avenues. The first, and most cost-effective, is to remove the FICM from the engine and replace the power board. The power board is what converts voltage from your car battery to the voltage needed to fire the injectors, and it is almost always the culprit of a bad FICM (the other half, the logic side, is almost never at fault). If you’re uncertain about changing the power board yourself, you can always get your FICM checked out by a specialist. Having a professional perform your FICM repair can lead to more peace of mind and a more accurate fix. If, for whatever reason, neither of these options work, purchasing a brand-new FICM is possible.</p>
          <p>If you’re wondering where you can get the most reliable and high-quality FICM parts, look no further than <a href=""https://usdieselparts.com/"">US Diesel Parts</a>. We offer a variety of FICM parts that you can count on if you’re having FICM trouble.

<div class=""row"">
     <div class=""col-12"">
          <p>When you are running a diesel engine, a turbocharger can be an invaluable asset to your driving experience. Often referred to as simply a “turbo”, these parts are fitted to an engine in order to increase its performance in a variety of ways. Turbos boost the power of cars and trucks, helping them reach top speeds faster. They enhance the power of your engine without requiring the effort (and cost!) of an entirely different engine. These parts are also fuel efficient and eco-friendly, making for an all around beneficial experience from their addition.</p>
          <p>Turbos essentially work by pushing more air into an engine. This happens through the use of exhaust fumes, which function to spin an air pump inside the turbocharger. The influx of additional air increases the combustion efficiency of the engine, which therefore increases its horsepower.</p>
          <p>A turbo can be incredibly useful when operating a vehicle. Like any part, though, a turbo is susceptible to failure. Luckily, turbos give off many signs of gradual failure, and these signs can make it easy to know when something is wrong and whether something must be done to fix it.<p>

     <div class=""col-9"">
          <p>One of the most prominent features that can tip you off to something being wrong with your turbo is a sudden decrease in acceleration. A turbo’s main function is to provide more horsepower to the engine, and an increase in horsepower should imply an increase in speed; this also includes the acceleration. The power of your engine should be felt when you have a functional turbo, and in turn you should be able to feel a lack of power that signifies your turbo may be failing.</p>

          <p>If you are quickly running low on engine oil, it may be a sign that your turbo is beginning to fail. The turbo can be investigated to look for signs of a leak, or perhaps for any signs of oil deposit in your turbo pipe; regardless, if you can determine that the issue doesn’t have anything to do with the engine itself, it’s likely that a failing turbo is to blame.</p>

          <p>A turbo that is in gradual failure will begin to make a loud whining noise that you can’t miss. As the problem with your turbo worsens, so too will the sound; it’s as if the turbo itself is telling you to take a look at it. When you hear a high-pitched, siren-like noise coming from your engine, consider checking out your turbo.</p>

          <p>A worn out turbo will have issues with the seals and will begin to crack, causing oil to leak into the exhaust system of the engine. A healthy engine’s exhaust will be clear; you can tell that there is a problem with your turbo when your vehicle begins to emit a lot of exhaust in a distinctive bluish-gray color. This becomes worse when you drive quickly and engage the turbo; noticing this smoke worsen when you drive at speed means it is almost certainly because of your turbo./p>

          <p>Your engine management light, or check engine light, can come on for a variety of reasons. If, however, it is coupled with any of these other symptoms, the check engine light is probably related to your turbo. Even if it ends up not being related, you should get your engine checked out if this light comes on anyway; it is better to be safe than sorry!</p>
          <p>A turbo failure can be related to any of these symptoms, and it is important to get your turbo checked and possibly replaced.

<div class=""row"">
     <div class=""col-12"">
          <p>Whether you’re a seasoned expert or a new diesel enthusiast, you may find yourself asking the question “What is a CP3 conversion?”</p>
          <p>Simply put, a CP3 conversion means replacing a CP4 injector pump with a CP3 pump. The CP4 pumps have largely replaced CP3 pumps in manufacturing over recent years because the CP4s can become problematic, sometimes resulting in engine failure. To avoid these issues, a CP3 injection pump conversion kit can help you with your installation.</p>
     </div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
     <div class=""col-12"">
          <h2>What is a CP3 fuel injector pump?</h2>
     </div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
     <div class=""col-9"">
          <p>The purpose of a CP3 injector pump is to create and regulate high-pressure fuel, giving you more horsepower. It’s found in diesel vehicles, mostly in models manufactured from 2001 to 2010.</p>
          <p>The CP3 pump has the capacity to flow a 20% higher volume of fuel than the CP4. Because of this, it can support more horsepower for your vehicle.</p>
     </div>
     <div class=""col-3"">

     <div class=""col-12"">
          <h2>Why would I need a conversion?</h2>
     </div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
     </div class=""col-12"">
          <p>A CP4 injector pump has the same purpose as a CP3 pump, but is used in newer diesel models primarily from 2011 to 2016. There are two variations for the CP4; the CP4.1 and the CP4.2. The latter is the one we will be referencing, as it has multiple pumping elements and is primarily used in the larger engines of American trucks.</p>
          <p>When there’s insufficient lubrication between the components, the CP4 rollers start to grind instead of sliding smoothly against each other. This friction has been known to cause the CP4 to grenade. This self implosion sends tiny metal scraps throughout the fuel system.</p>
          <p>If this problem occurs, it can cause catastrophic damage to the major fuel system components. This CP4 engine issue sometimes requires a fuel contamination kit, a disaster kit, or a repair that can cost upwards of $8,000.</p>
          <p>Fortunately for diesel truck owners, <b>the CP4.2 pump can be replaced before it causes destruction</b>. The fix to this problem is by replacing the CP4 injector pump with a CP3, which does not harm the engine when it stops working.</p>
          <p>Don’t let the numbers fool you, the CP3 is not a step backward in the injection pump evolution. It's a tried and true design that’s proven to carry a higher volume of fuel, making it stronger and more reliable than the CP4.2.</p>

<div class=""row"">
     <div class=""col-12"">
          <p>If your diesel engine is in need of a CP3 fuel pump conversion, you may also want to ask yourself if your conversion requires tuning or not. With so many conversion kits available on the market, it can be difficult to know which is the best fit for your engine and if you should purchase one with or without tuning. We’ll break it down for you using our US Diesel Parts kits as examples so you can decide if your CP3 conversion requires tuning.</p>
     </div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
     <div class=""col-12"">
          <h2>What is tuning?</h2>
     </div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
     <div class=""col-12"">
          <p>Tuning a diesel truck simply means optimizing the engine to fit the driver’s specifications by checking on and reprogramming the main elements of the engine. Different tools are out there to tune specific parts of your engine, and some can improve your fuel economy while others can give you more horsepower, torque and speed. For CP3 conversions, some kits require tunings to run properly while some do not. Let’s take a look.</p>
     </div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
     <div class=""col-12"">
          <h2>No Tuning Required Kits</h2>
     </div>
</div>
<div class=""row"">
     <div class=""col-6"">
          <p>To start, take a look at the <a href=""https://usdieselparts.com/i-24074473?q=cp3+conversion"">Industrial Injection - 2011-2016 LML Duramax CP4 to CP3 Conversion Kit with CP3 Pump (NO Tuning Req)</a>. This kit does not require tuning because it's designed to work with the factory setting.</p>
          <p>In other words, the CP3 fuel injection pump in this specific kit is a direct replacement for the factory CP4 pump, meaning no altercations need to be made in order for it to work.</p>
          <p>This option makes the conversion easier by eliminating an additional step. Because of this added convenience, non-tuning conversion kits tend to be more expensive than ones needing tuning.</p>
     </div>
     <div class=""col-6"">

          <p>Some conversion kits, like our <a href=""https://usdieselparts.com/i-24068764?q=cp3+conversion"">Industrial Injection - 2011-2016 LML Duramax CP4 to CP3 Conversion Kit with CP3 Pump (Tuning Req)</a> require tuning to run properly. These kits are to only be used with trucks that have tuning capabilities.</p>
          <p>Tuning offers customization to fit your preferences and set a desired rate of flow. This is beneficial because it allows you to control if you’d like more horsepower, durability, power or performance.</p>
          <p>Because altercations still need to be made, kits that require tuning are typically less expensive.<p>

<div class=""row"">
     <div class=""col-12"">
          <p>In short, the answer to “Does a CP3 conversion require tuning?” is both yes and no. The answer depends on the kind of kit you get for what best suits your preferences for your truck.</p>
          <p>A CP3 fuel pump conversion kit that does not need to be tuned is more expensive, but it is quick and easy to install. A kit that requires tuning may take a little more work, but it offers customizability for your diesel engine.</p>

"9968","3 Parts to Help Boost Your Cummins Engine's Performance","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For any Dodge diesel truck owner, the most prominent part in their vehicle that easily requires the most care and attention is the Cummins diesel engine that lies under the hood.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although the manufacturing giant has introduced a variety of updates to its Ram platform over the past two decades, its engine remains as the most prominent piece of all. With higher performance numbers, more effortless maintenance experiences, and top-rated reliability, this powerhouse of a mechanical machine is a selling point for most, if not all, owners.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Beyond reliability, torque, and efficiency, one aspect of Dodge&rsquo;s Cummins diesel engines that continues to steal the spotlight is </span><strong><em>its ability to upgrade for performance.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<h2><strong>A tamed beast that can be trained</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cummins engines have assumed the role of being the poster boys for diesel performance in recent years because of their systems&rsquo; immense potential. Although other engine options in the market offer formidable ratings and enjoyable experiences, the Ram platform&rsquo;s engines bear far more opportunities to juice the untapped power beneath the hood.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The performance part market for Cummins engines is exploding as various manufacturers stake their claim in the market to exploit the diesel powerhouse&rsquo;s capabilities. For instance, US Diesel Parts continues to see sharp increases in its inventory of Cummins performance parts with more product offerings seeing the light of day, to the point where we have more than a hundred options in stock!&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Looking to full-utilize your Cummins diesel engine? Consider using these parts</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Seeing that the market is rife with a load of options that bear significant opportunities to consider, you might be wondering how you can make the most out of your engine. Among the hundreds to thousands of available part options on the market, we&rsquo;ve compiled a list of three alternatives guaranteed to fetch you staggering results:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Upgrade option #1: </strong><strong><em>Turbochargers</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although the stock turbocharger that comes with most Cummins-powered Dodge Ram trucks is sufficient for taking their performance to the next level, upgrading will go a long way. With the help of an aftermarket option, you can further enhance the capabilities of your engine and increase the lb-ft of torque and horsepower it puts out in no time.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Upgrade option #2: </strong><strong><em>ECM/ECU Flashes or swaps</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the biggest hindrances to any Cummins engine&rsquo;s performance is the set of limitations imposed by the stock ECM/ECU unit used by Dodge&rsquo;s trucks. It may seem menial at first, but an ECM flash or performance upgrade can go a long way considering that it tends to various aspects of performance, such as fuel injection rates, combustion ratios, and boost compressions!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span></p>
<h3><strong>Upgrade option #3: </strong><strong><em>Aftermarket air intakes</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Similar to the turbocharger, the air intakes of these truck engines suffer from the same problems. Although they&rsquo;re sufficient, they&rsquo;re still far from capable of achieving optimal performance. When you take the time to swap out your intake for an aftermarket air intake (such as the ones that we have in stock), you&rsquo;ll be able to increase the opening for airflow in your engine and boost your horsepower ratings while</span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> achieving better fuel economy!</span></em></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With a Dodge Cummins diesel engine, the quest for power is an entirely feasible one because of the massive potential that the mechanical specimen bears. This is </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">especially possible if you&rsquo;re using the right performance parts. </span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With the help of the three tips mentioned above, you&rsquo;ll be able to see sharp increases in your truck&rsquo;s power in no time and genuinely enjoy the level of performance that Cummins diesel engines are revered for!</span></p>

"9969","3 Telltale Signs Your Turbocharger Needs Repair Work","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The turbocharger, or turbo for short, is a crucial part of your vehicle. It has been designed to create an efficient and powerful fuel system, used to keep your car up and running. It also minimizes the harmful emissions that harm the environment, further making its role crucial.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For an engine to be powered, air needs to be mixed with fuel. The fule then gets ignited and burned to create power. Following the formula, we can then state that the more air added, the more fuel can be burned. This is where the role of your turbo comes into play&mdash;it supports by adding additional air into the system, thereby helping fuel to more for additional power. As a result, you get a faster car, all the while reducing exhaust emissions that add to air pollution.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regardless of your current engine of choice, diesel engine or not, it&rsquo;s undeniable that turbochargers are good investments. They&rsquo;re not immune to breakdowns, however. They need proper care and maintenance, but it also pays to know the most common signs of turbo damage before your vehicle gets affected. Here are some of them:</span></p>
<h2><strong>Sign #1: Increased consumption of gas</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your turbocharger has been added for better fuel efficiency and economy. If you find yourself making frequent trips to the gas station, something may be wrong. You may also see a noticeable decrease in your vehicle&rsquo;s miles per gallon (mpg), which is a telltale sign of a malfunctioning turbo.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you see these signs, get your turbo checked right away. Raw fuel may be leaking from the turbo into the exhaust, which can be dangerous&mdash;raw fuel, especially from a diesel engine, can easily be ignited.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Sign #2: Poor acceleration quality&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Apart from better fuel economy, your turbo is also responsible for increasing engine power. If you find that your car is suffering from a decreased acceleration quality, it means that it&rsquo;s running on reduced power. The culprit could be your turbo, so have it checked by an expert right away.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A delayed response from your car after stepping on the gas pedal or failure to match the speed you&rsquo;re looking for are just some of the most common occurrences. But as soon as you feel that something may be off, get your turbo checked&mdash;don&rsquo;t use your vehicle until it gets sorted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Sign #3: Too much exhaust smoke</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the reasons why people invest in turbos is because they reduce the smoke emission from the exhaust pipe. If you find your vehicle emitting excessive smoke, your turbo may be defective. It may be suffering from a crack in the housing, which causes oil to leak into the exhaust system. As soon as you notice the exhaust being too much, consult an expert immediately. Exposed oil can further damage not only your turbo but the rest of your vehicle.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Turbochargers are innovative products that changed the name of the game forever&mdash;people can now drive smaller cars with the same power, and people can now enjoy diesel engines without the fear of contributing to air pollution.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While turbochargers have been built to last, it is not immune to maintenance and breakdowns. As such, it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind these symptoms in mind. If your turbo shows any of the signs discussed above, make sure to visit your mechanic right away. Doing so will save you from further complications.&nbsp;</span></p>

Seeing that diesel fuel is far more efficient than gasoline when it comes to energy-conversion (by as much as 20 percent), it would be a waste not to maximize it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>How you can make the switch to a more fuel-efficient driving experience</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Generally, many factors need to be considered when trying to put a more fuel-efficient truck together. However, there are </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">three</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> primary factors that you should weigh to make the most significant difference without going overboard on the details:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Factor #1: </strong><strong><em>The type of truck you&rsquo;re dealing with</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the most significant factors that you&rsquo;ll need to tinker around with when coming up with a more fuel-efficient driving experience is the truck itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although a 4x4 may sound like a great idea now because of all the adventures it can take on, the truth is that you may not necessarily want to go for such a platform because they guzzle gas. If you&rsquo;re about to buy your truck, you may want to opt for a 4x2 or two-wheel-drive option instead because they&rsquo;re rated for greater fuel mileage and are at lower risk parasitic fuel loss.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Factor #2: </strong><strong><em>The fuel additives you&rsquo;re using</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It may sound a bit trivial at first to expect massive gas savings by using additives. Yet, the truth is that these bottles of specially-formulated compounds are guaranteed to help you maximize your mileage if they&rsquo;re used right. The products that US Diesel Parts have in stock, for instance, are rated to add anywhere between 10 to 15 percent to your truck&rsquo;s miles per gallon because they&rsquo;re optimized to achieve top burning ratios for fuel-efficiency!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span></p>
<h3><strong>Factor #3: </strong><strong><em>The type of injector system you&rsquo;re using</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When people take a look at their diesel trucks and try to dissect them to achieve better mileage, one part that often gets overlooked is the set of fuel injectors under the hood. Although factory-standard injectors are adequate, getting an upgraded part that achieves more precise sprays for a better air-fuel ratio makes it much easier to get more miles per gallon. Once you make the necessary upgrades and configure your ECU alongside the installation, you&rsquo;ll be able to improve your truck&rsquo;s fuel economy without sacrificing raw power!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As great as an abundance of power and torque may be, it pays to build a truck that stays fuel-efficient in the long run so that you can save yourself lots of gas and money. By keeping the three factors mentioned above in mind, however, you can hit the road with a ride that&rsquo;s as diesel-conservative as it is powerful!</span></p>

"9971","Clutch Types: Which Is Best for Your Manual Transmission Truck?","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Did you know that about 97 percent of all diesel pickup trucks sold in the US for the last 20 years come with an automatic transmission? It&rsquo;s clear that most truck drivers prefer vehicles with an automatic transmission over a manual one for various reasons. However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that there are no drivers left with a manual transmission. Some drivers are still using a manual transmission, and when it comes to this, picking the right clutch usually makes all the difference in their overall driving experience.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this article, we will share what a clutch entails and which type to select for your manual transmission vehicle:</span></p>
<h2><strong>Three main factors impacting the clutch</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In a nutshell, a clutch is a mechanical device that transfers the rotational power from the </span><strong>diesel engine</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to the wheels. It connects two or more rotating shafts&mdash;one coming from the engine and the other turning the wheel. Ultimately, it is a vital part of a truck&rsquo;s machinery where the </span><strong>engine</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> generates power all the time, with some parts constantly rotating and the wheels not continually spinning.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to how much torque a clutch can transfer without slipping, here are three factors to consider:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Surface area: </strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This refers to how many square inches of friction materials are in contact with the flywheel.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Clamping force: </strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This pertains to how hard the pressure plate squeezes.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Coefficient of friction:</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> This identifies what it&rsquo;s made out of and how strong the grip of the material is.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What clutch to look for</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at some of the most popular types of clutch for a manual transmission vehicle, as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Organic Clutch Kit:</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Most trucks leave the manufacturing factory with a woven organic part. This type has a smooth engagement, high resistance to wear, and mid-level torque rating. Should it become damaged or need a replacement, simply replace it with another kit.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Ceramic Single Disc Clutch:</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> It&rsquo;s more likely that you will slip the Organic clutch once you&rsquo;ve performed some basic performance upgrades, such as intake, high flow exhaust, and a tune. When confronted with this problem, having a Ceramic Single Disc Clutch can be your best option. This consists of copper, iron, bronze, and graphite that are considered effective for a higher coefficient of friction. It can also endure so much heat and hold more power than an organic part. However, just be wary of losing a smooth engagement that you&rsquo;re used to with your organic disc.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>South Bend Full Ceramic Clutch: </strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This part has a higher power capacity, which is perfect for those wanting to boost their vehicle&rsquo;s horsepower. This type has a torque rating of 1,100 lb.ft. in a single disc application, and works great even when your truck performs towing and hauling functions.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At this point, you now know what types of clutches to choose from for your manual transmission truck. Apart from these three, there are other various types you can use in friction compounds, such as metallic blends, Kevlar, bronze, and even graphite.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ultimately, your selection all boils down to how the manufacturer employs balance engagement, heat resistance, longevity, and power capacity for your manual transmission. Be sure to choose the one that works perfectly for your manual transmission truck!</span></p>

"9964","Understanding the Functions and Benefits of a Lift Pump in Diesel Engines","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Diesel engines are already powerful and fuel efficient on their own, but there are a few things you could do to make the most out of your engine (in particular, using the lift pump). After all, even with the largest tank and the most powerful engine, an improperly fitted lift pump might just mean that you are not making the most out of your fuel, or that you may even be underfueling your engine.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The benefits of lift pumps</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While the power output of the engine is dependent on a lot of factors, you could increase this by hooking up your lift pump to your factory suction and feed lines. Your limiting factor here will be the flow rating of the lift pump you chose. However, extra precautions might be taken, especially if you use an aftermarket lift pump to increase your power level and fuel delivery volume.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lift pumps are an essential part of truck customization, especially if the goal is power. They are not as visually-pleasing as a supercharger, but are no less essential. In addition to raising fuel volume, they also improve filtration, allowing better quality fuel to run through the system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>How they work&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A lift pump supplies low pressure fuel from the tank to the injection pump on the engine, providing roughly 8&ndash;15 psi of pressure supply. The injection pump or injectors then pressurizes the fuel into the cylinder at somewhere between 15,000&ndash;30,000 psi.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The lift pump reduces the effort that has to be made to pull the fuel all the way from the fuel tank. Having a lift pump can extend the lifespan of your engine, especially since it reduces the stress on the injection pump or injectors. It does this by preventing fuel starvation, which is incredibly damaging to the entire system.</span></p>
<h2><strong>When would I need one</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In any instance where you hope to push your vehicle beyond the stock limits of its power, a lift pump is advised. After all, the injection pump and injectors are the most important components of a diesel engine. With a lift pump, you can supply your engine with bubble-free and purer fuel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Such needs arise if you like to customize your vehicle, or if you would like to raise your truck&rsquo;s suspension. Raising it puts strain on an engine that could definitely be alleviated by a lift pump.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>What would I need to watch for</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you are investing in a lift pump, invest in a gauge as well to make sure it is operating at optimal conditions. Make sure to note for fuel pressure drops, under-acceleration, or wild up-and-down pressure swings. These are signs that there might be a problem with your lift pump system,</span></p>
<h2><strong>In conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lift pumps are fully optional, as most trucks are designed to a specific level of power output already. But for the more discerning needs and preferences, a lift pump could extend the lifespan of your diesel engine and also your car. This is especially necessary if you plan to use your truck in rough terrain.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And if you&rsquo;re interested in ordering a </span><a href=""https://usdieselparts.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">lift pump for your truck</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, send us at US Diesel Parts a message.

"9965","How to Boost Your Automatic Transmission & Driving Experience","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to operating and running a diesel truck, you will want to ensure a safe and quality driving experience. However, many factors can contribute to achieving this, such as the vehicle's parts that make your vehicle accelerate, steer, and stop. On top of this is the transmission, which plays a crucial part in the overall driving equation. The ultimate goal is to ensure that all components are properly installed so that your automatic transmission works efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this article, we&rsquo;ll share five tips on how to boost your automatic transmission and enhance your overall driving experience:</span></p>
<h2><strong> Complete all the transmission parts</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It&rsquo;s crucial to install all the transmission parts completely to avoid any pitfall and mishap while driving on the road. Be sure to contact the right transmission builder and have the technician work on installing and setting the needed components. These parts include main billet shafts, extra clutches, a shift kit, raised line pressure, and a triple-disc billet torque converter. For your diesel engine, make sure to have a proper turbocharger sizing to ensure your vehicle&rsquo;s overall speed and performance.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Perform proper TCM tuning</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What&rsquo;s great about modern electronic transmissions is that they are controlled by a computerized system, which is known as a Transmission Control Module (TCM). This system is essentially responsible for shift RPM, torque converter lockup speed, shift duration, and even fluid pressure. However, you have to ensure that you perform proper TCM tuning regularly, and that all the hydraulic circuits and electronic controls should be calibrated to ensure smooth and comfortable shifts. Overall, adjusting the TCM's calibration with precise tuning will improve the lackluster performance of your truck.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Have lockup boxes</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A torque converter serves to multiply torque and get your truck moving. However, once your vehicle is on the move, it&rsquo;s best to lock your torque converter to allow a direct transfer of power to the rear tires. This is where lockup boxes come into the picture. They are needed to keep your converter locked up when you desire and even during a shift to improve your truck&rsquo;s overall acceleration and speed.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Utilize Co-Pilot</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Co-Pilot is a comprehensive kit that consists of a new electronic controller, wiring harness, and in-cab control module. This kit allows you to make necessary adjustments to the transmission line pressure and shift timing. Under light throttle conditions, the Co-Pilot keeps everything at a near stock level for less wear and tear on the clutches, which helps give a pleasant driving experience.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Find a balance for your truck</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to your truck&rsquo;s overall performance, maintaining balance is the key. Even if your vehicle has sufficient power and is installed with the best parts, it won&rsquo;t work without sufficient balance. For instance, you have to match your injectors and injection pump with your diesel</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">engine. You also need to have the right transmission upgrade that can hold the right amount of power. Ultimately, you have to plan and invest in the right transmission parts for the finest drive.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Improving your automatic transmission can be a bit tricky, but this boils down to installing quality diesel parts to make it work efficiently. As outlined above, be sure to complete all the transmission parts, perform TCM tuning, have lockup boxes, utilize Co-Pilot, and find a balance for your truck. With all these in place, you can expect to have an optimal automatic transmission and a great driving experience while on the road!</span></p>

"9966","2 Reasons Diesel Engines Are More Efficient Than Gas Engines","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Choosing a vehicle to purchase has become one of the commonly talked about and debated topics for many Americans today because of the available options on the market.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From two-seater sports cars to eight-seater family vans, the abundance of choice is one that affects nearly every vehicle in more ways than one thanks to the competitive industry. In the case of trucks, finding the right option to purchase has become a challenge because of all the models, trims, prices, and packages on the market. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Amid all the different battles and debates taking place, however, there&rsquo;s one mentioned far more often than any other when it comes to choosing a truck: </span><strong><em>Do I go with diesel or petrol?</em></strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span></p>
<h2><strong>The battle between diesel and petrol</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The main reason the debate between both options is as prominent as it is impactful today is that both engines have their respective set of advantages and features that make them unique from one another. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the case of petrol engines, the argument that often comes up is that they offer a more &ldquo;premium feel&rdquo; that allows the vehicle to sound better and &ldquo;</span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">pack on more power.</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&rdquo; On the other hand, diesel engines have many followers because of their rich heritage and irreplaceable presence in the world of American truck driving.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Among all the different factors to consider, the main one that many keep an eye out for when choosing between both options is </span><strong>efficiency. </strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it all boils down to objectivity, however, the winner is the </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">diesel engine.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<h2><strong>What makes diesel engines far more efficient</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to glossing over why diesel engines outclass petrol engines, there are various factors that will need to be considered. If you want to upgrade your daily driver to a far more powerful truck that&rsquo;s efficient and worth every dollar spent, here are two reasons diesel engines remain more triumphant:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><em>They offer more bang for your buck&nbsp;</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although both diesel and petrol engines get their fuel from the same source, the liquid hydrocarbon fuels formulated for diesel engines allow them to get more energy out of every single gallon. Thanks to the density of diesel in comparison with petrol or unleaded gasoline, diesel engines get 15 percent more heat by volume than their gasoline counterparts. This essentially </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">makes them more efficient by a mile!&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<h3><strong><em>They are far more efficient when it comes converting fuel into energy</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Apart from putting out more energy per gallon, what makes diesel engines superior over their gas counterparts is that they have an energy advantage that makes them almost 50 percent more efficient in energy conversion. Thanks to the way modern engines are built, they get to compress better for higher compression ratios. When combined with the persistent efficiency of their fuel source, the capabilities of a modern diesel engine then translates to better results!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it all boils down to efficiency, it&rsquo;s best to understand and assume that diesel engines beat their gasoline or petrol counterparts by a long shot. Similarly, </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">they&rsquo;re poised to stay that way for a much longer time. </span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you&rsquo;re looking for a truck that&rsquo;s worth every penny spent, has a host of performance opportunities, and is far more efficient when dealing with its fuel, then look no further because diesel options are the way to go!</span></p>

"9967","5 Factors to Consider Between Diesel & Gasoline-Powered Vehicles","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the automotive industry, many people often debate over which option is better for their truck: diesel or gasoline? Which has better performance and efficient fuel consumption? Should you go for a diesel-power car over a gasoline-powered one?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In essence, a combustion engine converts the chemical energy available in fuel into mechanical energy required to keep your vehicle moving. The difference between diesel and gasoline, however, lies in how the combustion occurs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For a diesel engine, the air is compressed, and the fuel is injected where the air heats up, and the mixture ignites. In a gasoline engine, on the other hand, the air mixes with the fuel, compressed by pistons and ignited by the sparks.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you are having a tough time choosing between a diesel-powered car and a gasoline-powered car, here are five key factors for you to consider:</span></p>
<h2><strong> Pricing</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sure, the syrup-like diesel fuel can cost more than watery gasoline. In actuality, it has more potential energy (given its energy per unit of weight) when compared to gasoline. For this reason, diesel vehicles get mileage in the 30s, 40s, or 50s. As there may be a slight difference in pricing, go for the more energy-efficient to help you save up in the long run. Of course, the pricing also depends on your vehicle and driving style.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Power&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to power output, you should consider these two crucial measurements&mdash;horsepower and torque. Horsepower measures power while torque focuses on the engine's twisting force on the driveline. While your vehicle needs a high horsepower, it's the torque that gets your vehicle moving.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Keep in mind that diesel has less horsepower but with high torque. For this reason, it is excellent for heavy goods vehicles like trucks or lorries carrying heavy loads. On the other hand, gas is ideal for sports cars requiring high horsepower but not as much torque.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Pollution</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the past, diesel engines had a hard time catching up with gasoline when it came to 'going green.' Today, diesel technology has greatly evolved and is now much cleaner than ever before. However, its fuel still doesn't burn as cleanly as gasoline. When it comes to reduced pollution, gasoline is indeed a more reliable option.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Noise</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Diesel cars of old used to sound just like trucks, no matter what type they were. The good thing is that modern technology has addressed this crucial concern, and the noise pollution emitted by old diesel engines is no longer a problem. Today, diesel engines essentially sound the same as gas-powered cars.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong> Reliability</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Know that</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">a diesel engine is more reliable because it uses compression ignition and requires less maintenance. It is also simpler than a gas engine since it runs without spark plugs and complex electrical works. Ultimately, it can outweigh a gas engine in terms of the miles or hours it can run before vehicle servicing is required.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At this point, you now know the five factors that can impact your decision in choosing between diesel and gasoline, such as the pricing, power, pollution, noise, and reliability. As each has its pros and cons in the automotive department, your decision ultimately boils down to what you need and how much you can afford!</span></p>

"9960","The Diesel Bug: Facts About It And How To Avoid It","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you plan to stock up on fuel&mdash;particularly diesel fuel&mdash;then you may want to rethink doing so. Stored fuel can deteriorate over time and lose its potency due to its reaction with oxygen molecules in the air. Storing a few jerry cans with diesel fuel is doable, but only until about a year or so. By that time, it may start developing sediments and hosting harmful bacteria and fungi.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you have a diesel engine in your vehicle, leaving it untouched for long periods of time may cause your fuel tank to develop condensation&mdash;which makes it easier for bacteria to develop. One of the most common microorganisms that can develop in your fuel is called the &ldquo;diesel bug.&rdquo; This takes form of sludge that can deteriorate your fuel and damage your engine&rsquo;s internals.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What Is The Diesel Bug?</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since fuel comes from organic materials, this can develop and house many types of bacteria. The diesel bug is a harmful bacteria that grows when diesel remains stagnant for long periods of time&mdash;which is why vehicles should be used as often as possible and refueled when needed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By scientific terms, this bug is the name given to microbial contamination predominantly found in diesel, mainly because of the existence of biodiesel in its chemical composition. While this is great for the environment, storing fuel is not so good, as the diesel bug can damage stored diesel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By composition, biodiesel is hygroscopic, meaning that it retains and attracts water better than other fuel types. Water is the perfect petri dish that encourages the growth of this microbial contaminant. It develops into resin-like gunk that sticks to the sides of a fuel tank, which, in turn, causes further build-ups.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With that being said, the existence of petrochemical diesel has fewer issues with the diesel bug due to the lack of water retention and attraction present in biodiesel. Be sure to seal all fuel tanks on your diesel engine truck, especially when going off-road because the diesel bug develops through the presence of water.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>A Slimy Presence In Your Fuel Tank</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The diesel bug can become a thick concentration, which gives off a slimy appearance with a brown or blackish color. The bug lives between water and fuel and smells like rotting eggs. This sludge is damaging to your engine when it goes into it, so be sure to drain it all out and replace it with newer fuel as soon as it&rsquo;s discovered.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can tell if your tank is contaminated if your car&rsquo;s filters constantly get blocked with the presence of sediments that look like coffee. Other signs you may experience are loss of engine power, putrid black smoke from the exhaust, an increase in fuel consumption, and hard starts.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The Damage The Diesel Bug Can Do</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Most diesel engine failures are due to contaminated fuel caused by the diesel bug. This menace can clog filters, corrode fuel tanks, wreck entire engines, and make you lose power while driving.&nbsp;</span></p>

"9961","4 Reasons to Use Diesel Engines for Industrial Vehicles","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Both diesel and gasoline engines are used in many different ways, but the former is the preferred option in most cases. Diesel engines are much more efficient and extremely durable, perfect for heavy-duty use in trucks, trains, and even ships.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you are considering between a diesel and gasoline engine for industrial vehicles, we recommend that you opt for the diesel variant. Here is why:</span></p>
<h2><strong> Higher horsepower</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thanks to the diesel engine's design, which allows a high compression ratio, it pumps out more horsepower even at low engine speeds. What is even more amazing is that the diesel engine uses less fuel than a gas engine in the process.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Due to the combination of increased power and fuel efficiency, diesel engines are perfect for operations that require high and steady torque.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Better efficiency</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As we pointed out earlier, a diesel engine uses less fuel compared to a gas engine&mdash;as much as 40 percent less! Add that to the fact that diesel is generally cheaper than gasoline, and you will be saving a lot of money on fuel.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is possible because the high compression ratio in diesel engines causes it to work at much higher temperatures. The increase in heat causes fuel to burn much more efficiently, allowing the engine to produce more energy to set a vehicle into motion.</span></p>
<h2><strong> More robust</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The components that make up a diesel engine, such as the pistons and crankshafts, are generally much more durable and sturdier than those found in gas engines. This is because its design is meant to compress approximately twice as much air as gasoline engines. As a result, stronger components are required to ensure that nothing fails while the engine is running.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Simply put, because of the need for the diesel engine to pump more air, the result is stronger components that last much longer, translating to an extended lifetime.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Cheaper maintenance</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thanks to the added strength the components of a diesel engine has, the parts become much more resilient to damage. At the same time, diesel itself can act as an excellent lubricant, allowing the components to work smoothly without fault. That, coupled with the fact that the engine does not have to work as hard to pump out the same amount of horsepower, means the diesel engine does not have to undergo as much strain.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All these different factors work hand in hand, ensuring that the diesel engine remains functional for long periods and reducing the need for maintenance.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As you can tell by now, diesel engines are the perfect choice if you are looking for a hardy engine that can deliver consistent results in your industrial vehicles. That said, gas engines are still viable options. That is because they are less noisy, cheaper to buy, and can start even in cold environments. Nevertheless, do some research before you pick an engine to make the best decision based on your needs.</span></p>

"9962"," A Truck Driver's Essential Guide to Diesel Fuel Injectors","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In any modern diesel truck, one reality that rings true every time is that each component in the assembly plays a crucial role in making sure that everything runs smoothly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From the pistons that pump air and fuel to keep the wheels rolling to the turbocharger that ensures that there&rsquo;s enough power to move, it&rsquo;s no secret that every part in the system must be taken care of at all times. Seeing that every component is as vital for optimal performance, getting to know how each part works will help a long way in keeping everything in tip-top shape.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Despite the importance of each part, there&rsquo;s one component that many drivers know far less of than they should: </span><strong>diesel fuel injectors.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2><strong>What are these injectors?</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Diesel fuel injectors are best defined as a component that&rsquo;s responsible for bringing the fuel right into the engine so that it can run and perform as they should.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In particular, modern parts are far more precise and interlinked with the engine control unit (ECU) to deliver precise amounts of diesel to achieve optimal fuel-to-air ratios for prime performance. Typically, these injectors are dissected into multiple portions and components, namely:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Nozzles:</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> these are responsible for precisely delivering fuel to the pistons&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Nozzle holders:</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> these hold the nozzles and ensure that they&rsquo;re directly placed and pointed towards the corresponding pistons they&rsquo;re supposed to supply. Together with the nozzles themselves, they comprise the whole fuel injection apparatus</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Fuel supply lines:</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> these components serve as the bridge between the gas tank and the nozzles</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Compression nuts:</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> these components are responsible for delivering streams of fuel at the right velocity to ensure that there are no lapses or suboptimal combustions&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether you drive a Dodge Ram, Ford F-150, or a Chevrolet Silverado, these delicate injectors play an essential role in ensuring that you get to drive around with top-notch performance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>How does this component work?</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The way that a diesel fuel injection system works can be generally described as a cycle-based process where controlled supplies of diesel move from point A (the gas tank) to point B (the pistons).</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When fuel goes through the supply line and right to the injectors, it gets held at the injectors pump before the ECU signals for it to release controlled quantities that are sprayed by the compression nuts and nozzles. Once the required amount of fuel is released, the compression nut then pressurizes the fuel to a certain level and moves it to the nozzle holder where it will be delivered to the nozzles themselves.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With the amount of pressure that the fuel is set at, the injector&rsquo;s nozzles open up and spray the diesel according to the settings that are maintained by the ECU. It&rsquo;s also vital to note that the resulting excess emissions that are generated by the fuel combustion chamber are handled by an attached exhaust valve to avoid over-combustion!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In any diesel truck&rsquo;s engine assembly, one crucial part that any driver should know about is the set of diesel fuel injectors that help keep everything running smoothly. By taking this guide into mind, you&rsquo;ll be able to arm yourself with all the right knowledge and a refined appreciation for the all-essential component!</span></p>

"9963","5 Ways You Can Improve the Performance of Your Diesel Engine","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Diesel-powered vehicles are popular among many people in need of private cars or light trucks, as they boast relatively lower emissions and better fuel economy. As the demand for private and commercial vehicles rises, so does the demand for diesel-powered cars. Acting in response to that demand, we will likely see diesel engine manufacturers offer a wider range of options and improved models to buyers in the coming years.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have a diesel-powered vehicle, it&rsquo;s important to learn how you can improve the performance of the engine, as this will allow you to keep it in peak condition for years to come. With that said, here are some ways you can significantly improve your vehicle&rsquo;s diesel engine:</span></p>
<h2><strong>Way #1: By getting a new airflow kit</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For your diesel engine to work efficiently, you should give it sufficient airflow. As such, you need to replace your airflow kit with a new one to increase its horsepower and improve its fuel economy. Aside from that, an effective airflow kit will allow cold air from the outside to more easily enter your engine compartment, helping increase the power output of the engine.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Way #2: By reprogramming the ECM</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another way you can improve the performance of your diesel engine is by upgrading or reprogramming your Engine Control Module (ECM). This particular engine component affects overall performance by adjusting the maximum RPM or air-fuel mixture. When you change your ECM, you can increase your engine&rsquo;s horsepower and torque and get better mileage out of it.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Way #3: By upgrading the fuel injectors</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You may also consider upgrading your fuel injectors to let more fuel into the engine and increase its horsepower and improve its fuel economy. Replacing fuel injectors will allow the individual injector nozzles to produce more pressure, which results in improving the engine&rsquo;s performance.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Way #4: By using turbocharges</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have the means, you can also install a turbocharger onto your vehicle to improve its engine power and performance. Doing so will also help facilitate better airflow by up to three to four times (sometimes five to ten times) than usual, depending on if you are using a stock or performance turbo. Regardless of your choice, a turbocharger will result in noticeably higher power output and improved engine efficiency.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Way #5: By upgrading the exhaust system</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Upgrading from the stock exhaust system to a performance exhaust system is necessary if your goal is to increase the airflow of your diesel engine. This is because a performance exhaust system has a relatively larger diameter and fewer bends compared to the standard variety, allowing better airflow throughout the system. It will also contribute to improving the torque and horsepower of your diesel engine.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Diesel engines can be easily and quickly customized to improve its performance. To do that, you may consider upgrading your airflow kit, ECM, and fuel injectors. Doing so can increase the airflow to your engine, so you must update your exhaust system as well to allow it to run smoothly. For a further upgrade, you may use turbochargers to achieve significantly higher power output and performance.</span></p>

"9956","Killing A Diesel Turbocharger: What You May Be Doing Wrong","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Modern turbochargers are tough nuts to crack and are much more improved than their predecessors. They can generate an extreme source of power that packs a punch when you step on the accelerator. Your diesel engine truck won&rsquo;t have the same kick without a turbocharger. Besides, who doesn&rsquo;t like hearing that whistle when you roll down the window and power through?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although these components are improved to be more durable and friendly towards consumer cars, they are not invincible. Some people may blow through their turbochargers without knowing that they are not paying attention to some important things. If you want your power snail to keep running at optimal health, here are a few ways you may be killing your turbo and how you can avoid them:</span></p>
<h2><strong>You May Have Seal Leaks</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Modern turbos use dynamic seals that keep the oil that is supplied to the center section from entering the intake or exhaust sides of the unit. Cranking up the horsepower without doing the proper upgrades can cause operational wear on these seals and lead to oil leaks due to the extreme pressure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The solution to this is to invest in a better crankcase ventilation system, as well as a dry-sump oiling system. If your turbo is old, perhaps you can even consider upgrading the entire turbocharger unit to suit the horsepower needs of your diesel engine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Failures In The Thrust Bearing</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Located near the compressor wheel, the thrust bearing is there to limit end play and rides on a thin film of oil between it and the shaft. The important thing is that the bearing does not come into contact with the shaft, as this will cause a bearing failure. Once this component is gone, wheel-to-housing contact will occur and destroy the turbo.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Instead of a 270-degree bearing, add a 360-degree one that provides a full circle of lubrication around the shaft, reducing the risk of failures. Purchase this when you are purchasing a new unit so that the lifespan of the turbocharger is longer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Surging</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Turbos are supposed to make a whistling sound, but once they start to bark or chirp, this is a bad sign for it. Compressor surge occurs when air intake is reverted back out of the compressor and is mostly experienced when an elevated boost is produced and cut off. That noise you will hear will be compressed air trapped in the intake and has no place to go except back into the turbo, causing damages due to pressure.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Prolonged surging will bring the thrust bearing to death, in which violent surging can blow the compressor wheel up. Blow-off valves are commonly used when there are high-surges from stronger engines. The trick to preventing surging is to source a properly sized turbocharger and purchasing boost gauges for your engine and stay at the proper RPMs and surge lines.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Overheating</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Anything that is heated to the extreme will likely die, and this is true in the case of car components. Turbochargers are subject to constant spinning inside the case, and this causes kinetic energy to generate heat. If the heat reaches above 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, the turbo will likely develop cracks on the body, damaged edges of the inlet volutes, and deformation of the wheel blades on the turbine.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Overheating is normally caused by a restricted exhaust system, cracks in the intercooler, or even a clogged air filter. The solution is to purchase a set of gauges that keep an eye on exhaust gas temperatures and monitor the way you step on the gas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Turbochargers are hardy devices that give your car additional power. They are not invincible, and not making the right upgrades or driving irresponsibly and recklessly can damage these. The last thing you want is a turbo to burst in your engine bay, so make sure you make necessary upgrades when bumping up the horsepower to prevent turbocharger damage.</span></p>

"9957","5 Tips for Protecting and Maintaining Your Diesel Engine","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Diesel engines are particularly lauded by car enthusiasts for their ease of use and versatility. However, many auto lovers will tell you that you must first familiarize yourself with the proper care and maintenance of a diesel engine so that yours will serve you well for many years.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this article, we are going to talk about tips, tricks, and considerations that go into protecting the quality and performance of your vehicle&rsquo;s diesel engine.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Regular oil and filter management</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether it is a car or a boat that you own, the more you use it, the more upkeep you have to perform to keep its lifespan long. The good news is that many products on the market have made this easier. Depending on the intensity of your usage and the current condition of your car or boat, you will have to change oil at regular intervals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It also helps to take it in for regular servicing whenever you can to ensure the longevity of your engine.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Don&rsquo;t let your fuel gel</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Winter and other situations of low temperatures can cause your fuel to clump and solidify, causing clogs in your filters. These clogs can restrict the flow of fuel and disable your engine. Worse, it can cause permanent damage.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A good solution to cold winters and low temperatures is to introduce additives to your fuel in order to reduce gelling. It is also important to have such products on hand, as sudden drops in temperature can be unexpected in certain places. Doing so can protect your car or boat from damage in the event that you have to start your engine in low-temperature conditions.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Check the filters and keep the air clean</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Contaminated air can wreck any engine, especially since many engines are now turbocharged these days. Having only clean air moving through your system means your engine will operate at peak performance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is important to know how often your filters need to be changed, and this depends on the manufacturer and the intensity of the vehicle&rsquo;s use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong> Lubricate, lubricate, lubricate</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Outside of clean air, high-quality fuel, and the filtration of contaminants from the system, the fourth need of a diesel engine is lubrication. This is true of any machine with moving parts.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Products like fogging oils can prevent your engine&rsquo;s moving parts from scraping against each other and lower the overall heat caused by friction in the system. Additionally, never forget to only use products that are meant for use with your engine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong> For boats: invest in water separators&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you expect the risk of your engine getting flooded with water, it might do well to add prefilters or additives to filter out the water from the fuels, as water that is introduced into the system can cause catastrophic damage to any engine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Any engine that is also regularly exposed to water (especially salt water) must be regularly cleaned and taken in for servicing in order to ensure the longevity of the vehicle.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Diesel engines offer ease to their owners but, as with all machines, require regular care and maintenance. With the right attitude and products, you should expect your vehicle to have a nice, long life, in addition to staying at peak performance.</span></p>

"9958"," What to Do If You Accidentally Put Gasoline in Your Diesel Truck","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ever since their humble beginnings, diesel engines were seen as an automotive revolution that would change the way Americans drive, and the same sentiment remains to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The many benefits of diesel-powered machines today have allowed them to become one of the most sought-after options in showrooms across the US. Although gas engines are enjoyable and dependable in their own right, many Americans find themselves devoted to their diesel counterparts because of reliability, lower gas costs, and unhampered performance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For any diesel truck owner, having such a vehicle is an enjoyable experience because of the way the engine pulls and feels on the road. From the moment that you bring your car out of the showroom to the day you go through its fifth or six engine oil change, driving around with your truck will always be fulfilling.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As enjoyable as the experience may be, the diesel truck ownership is still plagued with many concerns that are a source of worry. One such worry is the question of &ldquo;</span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">what happens when you put gasoline in a diesel engine?</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&rdquo;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Going over the common concern in further detail</strong><strong><br /></strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Admittedly, many diesel truck owners (or vehicle owners, in general) see the mistake of putting the wrong fuel in their truck as a mistake that has grave consequences. It may seem like the end of the world to some extent, but the truth is that you can turn things around and avoid any problems along the way by knowing all that you should about the situation!&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>What happens when you put gasoline in a diesel engine?</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Generally, the expectation that you should have if ever you put the wrong fuel into the tank and straight inside your engine is that </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">it won&rsquo;t work. </span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gasoline, contrary to misguided belief, isn&rsquo;t some type of &ldquo;richer diesel&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s entirely different in terms of composition,&nbsp;so don&rsquo;t expect &ldquo;</span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">prime</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&rdquo; performance!</span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span></em><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As opposed to putting diesel in a gas engine, you won&rsquo;t get a sluggish start when you do it the other way around. You&rsquo;ll just end up experiencing the sound, sight, and sensation of a starter that works but doesn&rsquo;t pick up.

"9959","2 Turbocharger Mistakes Diesel Truck Owners Should Avoid","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the American diesel truck industry (or motoring industry), no component or upgrade has been as relevant or impactful in recent years as the turbocharger</span><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While it may have gained popularity in the past two decades because of tuner cars, street racing movies, and imports, turbos (as they&rsquo;re also called) have played a crucial role in diesel performance for many years. If you were to take a look at a line of different trucks today, you&rsquo;d most likely notice that one of the few features they share is a little &ldquo;</span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">snail</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&rdquo; under the hood.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As pivotal as this component may be in helping a truck clear all paths and haul all types of loads, there&rsquo;s one crucial fact about turbochargers that many drivers overlook: </span><strong><em>It&rsquo;s easy to break&nbsp;or even kill them if you aren&rsquo;t careful.</em></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Why are turbochargers so brittle?</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although they&rsquo;re responsible for carrying an entire industry on their backs and further elevating the standard of modern diesel truck performance, turbochargers are still relatively fragile.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sure, they may be made of top-grade materials, but what makes them so delicate is that they&rsquo;re packed with an intricate series of nooks and crannies that are sensitive to misuse. Despite the levels of forced induction that they put out regularly, making even the smallest mistake can put this part&rsquo;s health in jeopardy, risking thousands of dollars in damage in the process. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to understanding why these breakages happen, the truth is that forced induction fumbles and teardowns are rooted in avoidable and simple mistakes. Fortunately, preventing your sub-hood snail from becoming another casualty can be avoided by being aware of the common errors and avoiding them.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Turbo-killing mistakes that should be avoided</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you&rsquo;ve recently become even more attached to the turbo you have under the hood of your diesel truck and want to ensure its longevity, here are two mistakes you should avoid: </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><strong>Mistake #1: </strong><strong><em>Failing to lubricate</em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Among all the aspects of turbocharger care that you should be well-aware of, a crucial aspect you can never overlook is that regular lubrication goes a long way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It may not seem like much at first, but having a lack of proper lubrication can ultimately kill the bearings that let your turbo spool and the air it takes in and forces into the engine. This costly mistake then leads to something called shaft play after experiencing extended periods of use without oil, causing the turbocharger to implode and fall apart.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fortunately, this problem can be avoided by lubing up your turbocharger regularly (depending on your manufacturer&rsquo;s recommended mile range) with the right type of oil!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><strong>Mistake #2: </strong><strong><em>Letting foreign object damage take place</em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At US Diesel Parts, we have received a significant amount of inquiries on what customers should do when a small object ends up getting chewed up by their turbo. When a turbo eats anything like a shop rag, clumps of dust, or a leftover bolt, it&rsquo;s bound to fail and will require immediate servicing or replacement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The best way to prevent this mistake from plaguing your diesel truck turbo is to swap your turbo&rsquo;s air filter every few thousand miles to prevent costly repair bills!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In today&rsquo;s era of diesel truck ownership, a turbocharger is one of the most vital components in the performance of any vehicle, making it essential to keep it in great shape at all times. By taking note of the two mistakes mentioned above and avoiding them, you can save yourself from costly repairs and make sure that your turbo lasts for many decades!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /><br /></span></p>

"9952","The Importance Of Your Suspension Systems And Ride Control Parts For Your Diesel Truck","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Keeping your ride control system in good shape is integral to staying safe while driving any car, as these give the stability needed to sustain higher speeds. If you are a diesel truck driver and are a fan of hitting the trails but have yet to upgrade suspension systems, you may experience certain issues with your chassis and ride control parts over time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Traditional SLA suspension systems contain four ball joints that are the usual suspects when it comes to clunks, squeaks, or odd noises when passing through bumps in the road. Strut suspension systems entail a wishbone combination, wherein the upper mounting plate can wear out and cause noises while running.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cars are supposed to make sounds, and that is a fact, but you should be able to differentiate if the sound is a usual sound that is normal and a sound that is trying to tell you something. Remember that suspension systems are responsible for stability when driving, whether it be offroad or on asphalt, and ultimately affect comfort and safety.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Check Ride Heights For Disparities</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your diesel truck has an optimal ride height that comes stock out of the factory and can be either lifted or slammed depending on the tastes of the user using coil-overs. When you measure the ride height, have the proper height in mind to determine whether or not your ride control system needs to be changed. If it does require a change, be sure to always do a full replacement of both sides, as this will reduce issues of irregular wear and tear down the road.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Depending on the age of your diesel truck, it will contain different spring types. Modern springs are coated with a plastic material to prevent it from corroding because of rust. Older ones may have no coating or have had it peeled off because of age. Additionally, check the bushings, as these are made of rubber or urethane, causing them to fail as they age.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Shock Absorbers And Strut Bars</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fortunately for us diesel enthusiasts, so many aftermarket diesel parts for better suspension systems exist. Whether your goal is for road comfort, or for the pure off-roading experience, there is a proper shock absorber for each, and in between. Running any shock absorber thousands of miles will wear it out, as these things are not immortal pieces of the car.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Remember that the suspension holds the monolithic weight of the truck, and mixing gravity with prolonged use will definitely wear down the shock absorbers. Some signs that it is time to swap them out are noticeable vibrations, bouncy rides, car chassis sways, and nose-diving when braking hard. These are all very dangerous, especially when you are driving at high speeds, so be sure to replace any wrecked suspension assemblies ASAP.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Watch Out For Leaking Fluids From A Strut Or Shock Assembly</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There is a life expectancy on each shock absorber product and strut bar, but it is still impossible to accurately predict when it gives out, as road conditions and driving style affects its lifespan. Driving smoothly on well-paved roads is a much better route to go for the survival of your car&rsquo;s suspension system. Manufacturers normally chalk the number up to 50,000 miles provided that the vehicle is being driven in optimal conditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shock absorbers use a hydraulic system that entails fluids being packed inside a strongly-built body, which gives it the stability to absorb the force caused by potholes and humps. Once the fluid leaks, this means that the shock is done for and is due for a replacement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Suspension systems are an integral part of a car&rsquo;s anatomy, as these affect the way we direct the car&rsquo;s steering, and our safety when cruising down the highway. Wobbly rides that feel unstable when you hit the brakes mean that the ride control parts are likely damaged and require immediate attention. Always remember that if you own a diesel truck and plan to ruck it off to the trails, this requires a good amount of upgrade parts, starting with engine upgrades and suspension systems.&nbsp;</span></p>

"9953","Top 4 Mods For Increasing The Fuel Mileage Of Your Diesel Truck ","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the automotive world, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of things that are more distinctly American than the diesel truck. Prized for its versatility, looks, and raw power, the diesel truck is a true cultural icon that has stood the test of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For all its merits, diesel engines are also known to be fuel guzzlers&mdash;which makes sense, given its size and the hauling power that it typically needs. With the price of diesel going up with each passing day, however, a driver needs all the help that one can get to make the most of every drop of fuel in the tank.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are four areas that you can improve to help increase the fuel mileage of your diesel truck.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Intakes and Filters&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you&rsquo;ve been driving for a significant period of time, you&rsquo;re probably already aware that your intake system is responsible for allowing air to reach your car engine. This process is incredibly crucial for the proper combustion of fuel to propel your truck to movement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One modification that you can do to increase your truck&rsquo;s fuel efficiency is by swapping your stock intakes and filters for a cold intake system. Through it, the temperature of the air that it feeds to your engine is better regulated&mdash;helping ease your fuel usage. This happens because cold air allows for a more efficient fuel burn due to its increased mass. Another small but significant modification to your intake is by using performance air filters, which are durable, washable, and actually enhance airflow better than stock OEM filters.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Exhaust Systems&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Just like how an inefficient intake can force your engine to work harder than it should, a poorly working exhaust system can also hold your diesel engine back. While stock exhaust systems do get the job done, their narrow surface areas are causing your engine to exert more energy into expelling the waste gases out. You can help lessen the load on your engine by installing a larger diameter exhaust system with a smooth mandrel bent radius that will help improve fuel efficiency.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Diesel Performance Chips</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the more popular ways and easy-to-do modifications are installing performance chips. These chips work by modifying your engine&rsquo;s behavior in ways that can alter its performance&mdash;provided that your truck is compatible with them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A good example of this is the edge chip for Dodge Cummins, which is a tuner chip that provides better fuel economy, sharper throttle response, and higher torque for Dodge&rsquo;s line of Cummins pickup trucks. While it can seem counterintuitive, more power in your engine doesn&rsquo;t usually translate to more fuel consumption. Most of the time, it&rsquo;s the result of your engines being able to do their job freely without being encumbered by inefficient parts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Differential Gear Upgrade</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some of the most common modifications for pickup trucks are lifted rigs and oversized tires, which are usually strenuous on your differential gear. You will know that your truck&rsquo;s differential gear needs an upgrade if your truck feels sluggish on cruising speeds, and if your RPM feels a little too high for your speed. If the RPMs are too high, it&rsquo;s a good idea to raise or lower your drivetrain gear ratio.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With the price of diesel fuel quickly catching up to gasoline, it&rsquo;s important to ensure that you&rsquo;re making the most out of your fuel. You can do this by investing in higher performance parts that will keep your engine from working harder than it needs to be. Upgrading your parts will result in better fuel economy, as engines that are not held back by inefficient parts will also be able to produce more power.&nbsp;</span></p>

"9954","3 Diesel Engine-Killing Mistakes You Need to Avoid","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Diesel truck ownership, in most cases, is best defined as a rewarding experience that&rsquo;s filled with decades of reliability, millions of miles, and cherished memories when proper care is taken.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regardless of whether you&rsquo;re driving a Dodge Ram, a Ford F-150, or a Chevy Silverado, taking care of your truck in every way possible is an effort that&rsquo;s bound to get all the right results. From the transmission lines that keep everything running to the suspension that ensures a smooth driving experience, the number of components that need to be taken care of is plenty.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While each component is no stranger to its fair share of maintenance needs and has importance, there&rsquo;s one that you&rsquo;re probably not taking care of properly:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The engine.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Why it&rsquo;s vital to take care of your diesel engine,&nbsp;and how you&rsquo;re doing the opposite</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Despite the fact that they&rsquo;re seen as &ldquo;bulletproof&rdquo; by many automotive enthusiasts, the truth about diesel engines is that it&rsquo;s still possible to end up killing them inadvertently.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unlike other parts, the engine in any model easily proves to be one of the most vulnerable because of the many factors that affect it and all the ways one can harm it. Beyond vulnerability, what makes it so important to take extra care when protecting your diesel engine is that </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">getting a replacement costs as much as buying a new car at the dealership.</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fortunately, avoiding the possibility of accidentally ruining your diesel engine can be avoided as long as you watch out for these costly mistakes and avoid them:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Engine-killing mistake #1: </strong><strong><em>Not letting the engine itself warm up</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As opposed to other types of engines, diesel engines are especially reliant on the practice of properly warming up because they can only run smoothly when the bearings are thoroughly lubricated.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You see, when you jump right to revving the living life out of your diesel truck&rsquo;s engine as soon as you start it, you leave it prone to premature breakages that will lead to leaks, gasket failures, and warped heads. If you&rsquo;re new to the idea of warming up, then there&rsquo;s no need to worry because you can easily tell when your engine is at the right temperature by checking the oil and coolant temperature gauges!</span></p>
<h3><strong>Engine-killing mistake #2: </strong><strong><em>Not changing your filters on a regular basis</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Just like warming, regular filter changes are another essential practice that unlocks any diesel engine&rsquo;s potential for longevity and prevents it from prematurely breaking down. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They may not seem like much at first, but the fuel and air filters on your truck play a crucial role because they prevent other forms of damage in interlinked components. When you take the time to replace your filters on a regular basis, you get to prevent all sorts of costly engine-killing problems such as: </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Restricted or sub-optimal air and fuel flows</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Contaminated injection systems, which are a result of filter failure</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Compromised fuel economy</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Boost leaks</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Turbocharger, value, and piston damage&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Engine-killing mistake #3: </strong><strong><em>Not changing engine oil on a regular basis</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Among all the different fluids that your truck relies on, none are more vital than engine oil, which means that not following recommended procedures and overlooking the need for changing will cut its lifespan short.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In between recommended changing periods, the oil in a diesel engine can pick up a lot of nasty particles and substances that can severely damage an engine. Instead of waiting for your engine to suddenly seize up out of nowhere after going for thousands of miles past its due change, you can give it a new lease on life by sticking to the manufacturer&rsquo;s replacement recommendations! </span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to getting the most out of your diesel truck&rsquo;s engine and making sure it lasts as long as possible for many happy years, the best way to do so is by avoiding common engine-killing mistakes.

"9948","Top Diesel Vehicle Parts You Ought to Replace to Boost Performance - Our Guide","<p>Diesel-powered vehicles have become widely popular in the automotive industry. As diesel engines provide higher fuel economy and lower emissions, they&rsquo;ve become a more viable option for cars, light trucks, and other powered vehicles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's paramount to keep the parts of your vehicle in top shape and working condition. As far as the diesel engine is concerned, you have to find ways to improve its power and performance. For these reasons, your vehicle needs to be regularly serviced, and some parts should be replaced, if applicable.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are the top diesel vehicle parts you need to replace or upgrade to boost the performance of your car:</span></p>
<h2><strong>1. The oil pump and fuel pump</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The high-pressure oil pump primarily serves to circulate the oil in the engine. It acts as a lubricant where the oil is properly distributed throughout the engine. However, it's not enough to have a high-pressure oil pump for a powerful engine. You also need a solid fuel pump for efficient fuel circulation. For these reasons, it's necessary to have the servicing done to ensure that your pumps are working efficiently.</span></p>
<h2><strong>2. Cooling system</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It's common for your vehicle system to heat up, particularly if it's hitting the road for long hours. Without a proper cooling system, the heat can affect your vehicle components and impact the vehicle's overall motion and performance. That's why it helps to install a cooling system or replace your outdated one. Additionally, it also impacts the exhaust gas temperature.</span></p>
<h2><strong>3. Engine's airflow</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A proper airflow system to your vehicle's engine allows more air, thereby creating more power. Also, it draws colder air from the outside of the engine compartment. For this reason, it's best to upgrade the airflow kit of your vehicle. That way, you can increase the horsepower and improve the fuel economy of your engine.</span></p>
<h2><strong>4. Engine Control Module (ECM)</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ECM serves to regulate the engine performance of your vehicle. It allows you to alter or adjust essential engine parameters such as air-fuel mixture and maximum RPM. Hence, having your ECM reprogrammed or replaced can develop more horsepower and torque. Overall, properly controlled ECM can boost the performance of your vehicle.</span></p>
<h2><strong>5. Turbochargers</strong></h2>
<p>A performance turbocharger creates more power from your diesel engine. It works by pushing more air into the engine and pressurizing the air intake. In fact, a performance turbo can increase airflow five to ten times than a non-turbo engine. Therefore, installing or replacing your turbocharger can make all the difference.</p>
<h2><strong>6. Exhaust system</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There's a need to upgrade your old and outdated exhaust system. That said, opt for a performance exhaust system with a larger diameter and fewer bends. This type increases the exhaust flow through the system. At the same time, it reduces the exhaust gas temperature and improves the power of your engine</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regular servicing of your diesel-powered vehicle is imperative, along with replacing some parts if necessary. Whether the oil pump, cooling system, or the exhaust system, having them checked and replaced can boost the overall performance and efficiency of your diesel-powered vehicle.</span></p>

"9949","Our Guide to the Dodge Ram Bosch VP44 Diesel Injection Pump","<p>Among all the different available models, no line of vehicles has become as iconic or pivotal in the history of diesel trucks than the ever-dominant Dodge Ram Cummins trucks.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From the moment that the first model was released in 1989, the American market experienced a shift in truck quality that would never be replicated by any other brand again. Upon its release, Dodge&rsquo;s all-performance truck changed the standard that consumers and drivers looked for in their vehicles thanks to the many benefits that the manufacturer introduced.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Over time, this legendary line of trucks has maintained its significant impact on the world of functional performance because it continues to innovate and take the potential of turbochargers and direct injection technology to the next level. Grossing millions of sales in the American market, it&rsquo;s clear that not many truck models are as celebrated or revered as the Ram,&nbsp;even more so considering how its top-notch styling set the world of truck modification alight. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span>Beyond proving that diesel trucks can be stylish while maintaining ruggedness and hardline, there&rsquo;s one more aspect about the Ram that helps make it the legendary truck it is today: the Bosch VP44 Diesel Injection Pump.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>An introduction to the Bosch VP44 Diesel Injection Pump</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although it may seem like an unsuspecting component at first, this fuel pump has primarily become responsible for allowing the Ram trucks to deliver their famed power and smoothness over years of use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thanks to the rigidity of Bosch&rsquo;s products and Dodge&rsquo;s engineering, owners have been able to find solace in an engine that provides absolute performance without sacrificing anything else. Aside from top-notch performance, this particular component has been able to stand out because of its undeniable performance, which is why drivers keep it even after modifying everything else!</span></p>
<h2><strong>How long does a standard VP44 diesel injection pump last?</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Just like any good thing, the injection pump is a delight that has its end sooner or later, which calls for an eventual replacement to make sure that everything gets back on track.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The standard VP44 set-up generally starts to falter in various degrees around the 150,000-mile mark. Depending on how you drive, this number can go higher or lower as parts like diesel injectors are greatly affected by the style in which a truck is driven. Alternatively, you may have to get a replacement pump if you modify anything else in your engine to accommodate any changes in power or fuel-related requirements. It is worth noting, however, that replacing a lift pump alone may suffice in some cases!</span></p>
<h2><strong>On matters of replacement</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unfortunately, you won&rsquo;t be able to find an exact same Bosch VP44 Diesel Injection pump replacement for your truck because Bosch no longer makes them. If you&rsquo;ve got a Dodge Ram truck that uses this type of injector and needs to be replaced soon, then you should get one of our </span><a href=""i-24068347-vp44-15x-injection-pump-98-02-dodge-5-9l-cummins-235hp-4spd-a-t-and-5spd-m-t.html""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">remanufactured VP44 Diesel Injectors</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to keep the same quality intact!</span></p>

"9950","2 Reasons You Should Invest in Aftermarket Diesel Fuel Injectors","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Every year, the American diesel truck market continues to grow rapidly thanks to the advent and advancement of modern technology and the ingenuity of modern manufacturers. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Each year, new trucks, engines, aftermarket parts, and system upgrades come up to bring the best out of any truck, whether it is a light grocery-getter or a heavy-duty load-hauler. As much as parts, models, and manufacturers can evolve each year, there&rsquo;s one component that will always help bring the best out of any truck no matter how old or new it is: </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Diesel fuel injectors.</span></em></p>
<h2><strong>What are diesel fuel injectors?</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They are an essential part of any diesel engine set-up because they&rsquo;re entrusted with the primary task of supplying the pistons with the needed fuel to run smoothly.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Apart from the pistons themselves, the injectors are crucial when it comes to getting any assembly to run and can never be overlooked when it comes to performance. This crucial part has repeatedly become a focal point for many talks in the industry when it comes to boosting engine performance or overall functionality. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Among all the different components in a diesel truck, the injectors are one of the components that you want to look at when trying to make the most out of your vehicle, </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">especially if you&rsquo;re looking to invest in aftermarket parts.</span></em></p>
<h2><strong>Why should you consider upgrading your diesel fuel injectors?</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although the standard set of fuel injectors in your stock truck can keep everything running smoothly, upgrading this crucial part presents a wide range of opportunities. When chosen well, an aftermarket set of diesel fuel injectors can expose your workhorse to a wide range of benefits:</span></p>
<h3><strong>Benefit #1: </strong><strong><em>It can be used to make even more out of a truck&rsquo;s performance</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the biggest benefits of upgrading any diesel truck&rsquo;s fuel injectors is that it opens up a wealth of opportunities to tweak its performance to suit your preferences. With an upgrade, you&rsquo;ll be able to get the most out of your engine&rsquo;s potential in a way that boosts its overall torque numbers and horsepower rating so that you can haul even harder, and run faster than ever before!</span></p>
<h3><strong>Benefit #2: </strong><strong><em>It makes it far easier to achieve fuel efficiency</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What most people don&rsquo;t know about fuel injectors is that they can extend any diesel truck&rsquo;s total rate miles per gallon with a few adjustments.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The main reason this part plays such a pivotal role in determining a truck&rsquo;s fuel economy is that it directly controls how much fuel is supplied to an engine and what rate it does so. When you upgrade this crucial part, you get to achieve even better air-to-fuel ratios because aftermarket options can be easily fine-tuned and tinkered with thanks to modern pieces of software and customizable settings!</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before you think about spending your money on upgrading different parts in your truck, it&rsquo;s a smart idea to consider shelling out even more on your fuel injectors because of the difference it makes in its performance. With the help of an aftermarket fuel injector, you can take your truck&rsquo;s long-term performance to stratospheric heights by taking control of the way it consumes gas!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span></p>

"9951","Make Your Diesel Fuel Last Long During Winter With These 3 Tips","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The change in weather can affect the blend of your diesel. A drop in temperature can turn your diesel into a thinner and less gel-like substance. In some cases, the diesel fuel in your tank will start to gel and freeze up. The worst-case scenario is when your fuel filter gets iced up, resulting in a damaged engine. When this happens, your fuel gets lower energy content, and it could mean reduced mileage for your diesel engine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can observe this sudden shift every wintertime. Because of the colder weather, your fuel won't last as long as it does in summertime. Luckily, there are ways to slow down this change. While you cannot completely stop your fuel from thinning down, there are ways to expand its lifespan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>1. Load it with additives</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What makes diesel fuel different from its gasoline counterpart is how it contains more energy per liter. During wintertime, the Cetane rating of diesel fuel lowers. Cetane rating is the measurement of the fuel's performance and quality. The higher the number, the faster the fuel burns in the vehicle's engine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The sudden drop in Cetane's quality indicates that the fuel loses some of its natural energy. One way to combat this is to use an additive like the Alliant Power Ultraguard or Stanadyne Performance Formula.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Combining any of these additives with the fuel forms a new mixture that can help counterbalance the effects of a low Cetane rating. The additive helps protect and lubricate the fuel injection system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Apart from that, increasing the Cetane improves your engine's performance and reduces its emissions. It also prevents any formation of algae or bacteria in your fuel tank by dispersing its water.</span></p>
<h2><strong>2. Perform these car maintenance activities</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can also conduct personal checks and balances in your vehicle to ensure that your diesel will last longer. Here are some of the things you can do.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Plug your truck to a block heater in the morning for around two hours before you start your engine </strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">- The block heaters can help reduce the duration of fuel-enriched combustion as the engine warms up. When this happens, your vehicle reduces fuel consumption and emissions.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Change your engine oil to synthetic oil - </strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Synthetic oils have smaller and more uniformed size molecules than non-synthetic oils. Because of this composition, less friction happens within, and this setting improves the vehicle's fuel economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Check your tire pressure -</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Under-inflated tires can lower mileage by around 0.2 percent.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3. Load your car with the right winter diesel and bring extra</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not all locations experience the winter weather, so you should not assume that the lower mainland will have a pump for your winter diesel. If you plan to travel far or go to colder and more mountainous terrains, make sure to load your vehicle with the right diesel fuel. It is also safer for you to bring extra fuel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The winter season is truly rough on equipment and vehicles powered by diesel engines. Regular checking, enough preparation, and a good knowledge of how diesel works during the cold season can help you make the necessary adjustments ahead.&nbsp;</span></p>

"9944"," 3 Vital Considerations When Choosing a Lift Kit for Your Truck","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are several aspects that are truly American than a well-maintained and lifted truck. You may be uncertain about how high you should go, but the more accurate question here is: how high are you willing to go?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many different types of lift kits are available in today&rsquo;s market, each appropriate for certain purposes and preferences. Some merely raise your truck by two inches while others can lift it up to ten. Before you invest in the impressive lift kit for your truck, there are a few points to take into account.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this article, we will share three vital considerations that you should consider when looking for the perfect lift kit for your truck:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong> The exact type and model of your truck</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All automotive manufacturers design their trucks in different ways. Each vehicle also can come with its own customization options, depending on how you went about purchasing your vehicle from the dealership.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before choosing a lift kit for your truck, make sure that you first determine its specifications in case you might need to buy other components and parts. Installing a lift kit, for example, can result in brake line extensions and alternate steering systems. Missing any one of these can put your truck out of commission until you can afford to buy that additional customization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong> How you&rsquo;re going to use the truck</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">No lift kits are equal, as they are all designed for different uses. For example, all-terrain trucks that are meant to drive over rocks and rough terrain would benefit from larger kits and larger tires. If the truck is going to be used to haul goods from one place to another, a lift kit that is high might make that inefficient; it might do better with simple 37-inch wheels.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is also important to consider how the lift changes the movement of the car, in terms of its center of gravity and turn radius. Larger lifts (and larger tires) also cause your engine to use more fuel than it normally would. If you are new to trucks and lift kits, it might be better to work your way gradually to taller trucks. It is important to be aware of your driving habits and needs so that you can select the right lift kit for you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong> Set a budget and stick to it</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As mentioned before, there are several customizations that may also need to be bought and installed other than your lift kit. The total cost of the lift kit, in addition to the other parts and services, will likely not be cheap.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Because of this, it&rsquo;s important to set a budget that doesn&rsquo;t break the bank, and that you stick to it. Be patient with your earning pace, and save up until you have enough for everything you need, including insurance and warranties, which can make or break your purchases in the event of a malfunction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ultimately, it all boils down to your preferences and needs. Whether you raise your truck by two, or ten, or thirty-six inches, with the right mindset and sufficient planning, you can have that all-American lifted truck of your dreams.&nbsp;</span></p>

"9945","What to Know If Your Vehicle Keeps Running Out of Gas","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For many diesel truck owners, the experience of driving is one that can be as fun as it is challenging.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While most days spent behind the wheel are experienced with productive, smooth, and exhilarating journeys in mind, the truth is that things can get ugly quickly if one is unprepared. From flat tires and blown gaskets to dead batteries and faulty starters, the list of predicaments that any truck owner can face during a trip is nearly endless because of all the bits and pieces involved.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regardless of how far modern automotive technology has come in terms of parts and contingency measures, there&rsquo;s one problem that many drivers are still struggling with: </span><strong><em>Running out of gas.</em></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Why do trucks run out of gas all of a sudden?</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to understanding why these automotive mishaps happen, it&rsquo;s important to remember that there is quite a range of causes to consider. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Generally, the most common ones fall along the lines of faulty fuel systems, malfunctioning gas gauges, or unexpected siphoning. Despite all the potential causes that can explain why diesel trucks end up running out of gas, however, the most logical explanation is that </span><strong><em>drivers don&rsquo;t know enough about their fuel tank&rsquo;s capacity.</em></strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Everything you need to know about your diesel truck&rsquo;s fuel capacity</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether you may a driver who pushes the limit of the warning light or one who heads straight to the station once the tank is half full, knowing about your fuel capacity goes a long way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For diesel truck drivers, getting acquainted with the standard fuel tank capacity is vital because it helps with improving the user experience and provides in-depth knowledge. Fortunately, knowing the capacity of your truck&rsquo;s tank and learning how to manage it doesn&rsquo;t have to be as difficult as you may expect as long as you follow this guide:</span></p>
<h2><strong><em>Regarding standard sizes</em></strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For the majority of Dodge Cummins, Ford Powerstroke, or Chevy Duramax trucks, the standard fuel capacity that comes with various models falls along the lines of 45 to 65 liters. Within the standard capacity mentioned above, however, modern models have an extra reserve tank that carries about 15 percent of the truck model&rsquo;s stated fuel tank capacity. At the same time, it&rsquo;s important to note that trucks cease to operate with 5 to 10 liters of fuel left.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong><em>How to improve or maximize your fuel tank capacity</em></strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Aside from topping out your fuel tank regularly, there are many ways that you can maximize your mileage and capacity to last longer with every drive. For instance, using </span><a href=""c-778840-fluids-additives.html""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">fuel additives</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> has been shown to yield significant developments when it comes to extending the overall capacity of a particular tank. On the other hand, getting an ECU upgrade or tune, running with new tires, and filling up the rubber with nitrogen instead of air all work wonders for optimizing the experience you get from your fuel tank!</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have a vehicle that usually runs out of gas, then there&rsquo;s no doubt that you&rsquo;re currently thinking about how you can prevent the same problem from happening again. With this guide&rsquo;s help, you&rsquo;ll be able to take charge of your diesel engine&rsquo;s gas consumption and make sure that you never embarrass yourself by running out of fuel ever again!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We&rsquo;re the leading </span><a href=""https://usdieselparts.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">diesel engine parts supplier</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in America that carries OEM and aftermarket parts for Ford Powerstroke, Chevy Duramax, and Dodge Cummins trucks.

"9946"," 3 Common Diesel Exhaust Fluid Issues & How to Avoid Them","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Among all the different concerns that any diesel truck owner could have, none have become as prominent or commonplace in recent years than </span><strong><em>diesel exhaust fluid (DEF)-related issues. </em></strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Certain problems such as DEF contamination, improper DEF handling, and incorrectly supplying a diesel tank with DEF are some of the many issues that could come about during your ownership experience.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><strong>DEF-related issues you may come across and how to avoid them</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /><br /></span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you&rsquo;ve run into such a problem recently but don&rsquo;t know how to solve it or how you can avoid its different variants, there&rsquo;s no need to worry because avoiding such a problem isn&rsquo;t difficult. In the sections below, we will share a few common problems associated with DEF and how you can avoid each of them:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Issue #1: </strong><strong><em>Contamination</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The most common problem that comes when dealing with DEF-related issues is contamination threats that can cause damage and prevent the chemicals from working properly.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In most cases, this problem comes up when contaminants that are located around the fill cap run right into the substance or when caps aren&rsquo;t cleaned before they&rsquo;re undone when adding fluid. Even the smaller specks of dirt and dust can cause many problems as soon as they fall in and end up getting washed down the tank, leading to prolonged downtimes along the way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How you can fix it</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: Given that dirty caps are the most common culprit when it comes to DEF contamination, the clear fix that you can use to avoid this problem is a proper cleaning before fluid application. Additionally, keeping your DEF in dedicated containers that are regularly cleaned will make a difference as it cuts out the risk of contamination by a significant amount.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Issue #2: </strong><strong><em>Confusion</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Aside from contamination, another common problem that many diesel truck owners run into when handling their DEFs is that they end up ruining their engines by accidentally filing up the gas tank with them. Although they may be within close proximity, the ports for the gas tank and DEF tank respectively must never be confused because even the smallest amount of the emissions control solution in fuel tanks will cause thousands in damage. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How you can fix it</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: The best way to avoid this common problem and drowning yourself in repair bills is to inspect your caps to ensure that you insert the fluid in the right tank. If you suspect that you&rsquo;ve put the liquid in the wrong tank, however, then pop both tanks out and drain and flush both with deionized water or clean DEF fluid!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><strong>Issue #3: </strong><strong><em>Improper handling</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many American diesel truck owners are often uneducated in terms of how they&rsquo;re supposed to handle the sensitive liquid to the point that they just carelessly store it somewhere, eventually degrading it. It&rsquo;s vital to understand that DEF is sensitive when it comes to temperatures and containers as it&rsquo;s a volatile liquid with an intricate chemical composition.</span></p>
<p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How you can fix it</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: When it comes to properly storing DEFs, you&rsquo;ll need to choose a cool, dry indoor location between 12 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit. Also, you should put the fluid in an expandable container to avoid diluting the liquid or having it turn into slush.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Messing up the process of trying to supplement your truck with a fresh batch of diesel exhaust fluid can easily lead to costly problems and damages, especially if you commit the same mistakes mentioned above. With the help of this simple, yet effective guide, you can save yourself time, stress, and money in the long run while making sure your truck runs smoothly!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We&rsquo;re the leading </span><a href=""https://usdieselparts.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">diesel engine parts supplier</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that carries OEM and aftermarket parts for Ford Powerstroke, Chevy Duramax, and Dodge Cummins trucks.

It consists of a fuel injection pump, high-pressure pipe, injection nozzle, feed pump, and fuel filter. This system pressures and injects fuel by forcing it into the air that has been compressed to high pressure. It serves to feed fuel, adjust its quantity, adjust injection timing, and atomize the fuel itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this article, we'll explore the four types of diesel fuel injection systems. Read below to see what you need for your diesel engine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong> Direct injection</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This injection type makes use of a powerful, positive displacement fuel pump. It pumps the diesel fuel through injectors that are mounted in the cylinder. This system works well with a</span><strong> diesel engine </strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">as it produces huge amounts of fuel into the combustion chamber. Hence, the combustion process becomes faster, quieter, and more powerful.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One major facet of direct injection is the fuel pump. This pump forms and functions like a small four-stroke engine. However, it passes liquid diesel fuel instead of air and fuel. The pump has positive displacement, making the fuel pressure high yet stable. Such pressure is required to inject fuel against the compressive force of a rising piston.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong> Throttle Body Injection (TBI)</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This injection type works like carburetion, which is where a lot of TBI units were patterned. Their difference lies in the fact that TBI employs a set of downward-facing injectors to shoot fuel into the engine under pressure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Modern diesel engines don&rsquo;t often have TBI since there are already far better alternatives. Besides, it doesn't work well with turbocharging, which is one of its disadvantages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong> Multipoint injection</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This injection type is similar to those used in cars, and it employs a single or dual fuel pumps to provide fuel injectors. These injectors are mounted in the intake port of the engine. What happens is that the injectors spray fuel into the engine's intake valves through the intake port.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As it is developed after the mechanical direct injection, the multipoint injection system is rarely used on most diesel types. Overall, it offers no real advantage for compression-ignition engines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong> Common Rail Injection (CRI)</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This injection type is both direct injection and multi-port injection rolled into one. It works like a multi-port injection, where it utilizes a common fuel rail to feed multiple fuel injectors. However, the difference lies in the fact these injectors are mounted inside of the direct injection.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Given this combination, it gives you the control and flexibility to regulate the amount of fuel injected and the injection timing via a computer. Overall, the single, powerful fuel pump is the driving formula for CRI's ultimate success.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So these are the four types of diesel fuel injection systems&mdash;direct injection, throttle body injection, common rail injection, and multipoint injection. Each has its own features and functions, as well as pros and cons. No matter what type of fuel injection system you choose, be sure that it serves your diesel engine needs well.</span></p>

"9940","3 Upgrades to Include in Your Diesel Truck Build","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Among all the different projects that any American could possibly dabble into, none yields more potential for fulfillment and long-term satisfaction than building a </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">diesel truck</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For many newcomers, the idea of tuning and upgrading isn&rsquo;t as clear-cut or obvious because the feeling of having a truck that&rsquo;s brand new overcrowds any underlying inadequacies. Such a feeling is far greater for those who&rsquo;ve had beat-up cars for far longer than they should have. However, this is one that will fade sooner or later once the possibilities make themselves known.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In most cases, the gateway to the truck build life begins with a small glimpse of exposure. Whether in the form of a social media post, a TV spot, advertisement, or a random conversation, you will learn how to personalize your beautiful truck further.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Over time, you&rsquo;ll start to notice all the drag racing videos that feature trucks, spotlights that revolve around a ludicrous build that doubles as a piece of art, or 4x4s climbing rocks. Now that you&rsquo;ve come across a slight glimpse of what you could possibly achieve with your truck, you&rsquo;ve finally gotten the itch to keep upgrading your trucks that it becomes the machine of your wildest dreams.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before you jump right into building a jaw-dropping, show-stopping, and head-turning diesel truck build, you may have a question that will later on lead to more money pit mayhem: </span><strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong><em>what should I start with?</em></strong><strong>&rdquo;</strong></p>
<h2><strong>What you can start working on and modifying</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you don&rsquo;t know where to start in your modification journey, here are three parts you should consider investing in before all else:</span></p>
<h3><strong>Upgrade #1: </strong><strong><em>Lift kits</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Out of all the different options you can use to make your truck stand out, none could get you above all the other vehicles than a lift kit. Whether you&rsquo;re looking to scale rocks and climb dunes or establish your status as the king of the road, a lift kit from various brands, such as Fox, Kryptonite, BDS Suspension, and Zone Offroad will do the trick!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><strong>Upgrade #2: </strong><strong><em>High-flow exhaust systems</em></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Aside from using a lift kit, another way to get your truck build started off is through the use of a high-flow exhaust system that will let you be heard </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">loud</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">clear. </span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With the help of a high-flow system, not only will you be able to bring out the rumble from your Powerstroke, Cummins, or Duramax engine, but you&rsquo;ll also help your engine maximize its power to yield top-notch performance numbers!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><strong>Upgrade #3: </strong><strong><em>Cold air intakes</em></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While it may be on the slightly-pricier side for a first upgrade, cold air intakes are essentially a must-have gateway aftermarket piece for anyone leaning to a power-focused build. Through the use of this component, you can boost the total amount of power your engine makes by boosting its oxygen intake while increasing its torque output along the way!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Starting a diesel truck build and truly personalizing a project is a fulfilling experience that pays for itself ten-fold if you do it correctly, especially if you start with the right upgrade. With the help of the three upgrade options mentioned above, you can get your diesel truck build dreams actualized and pulled off in the best way possible!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to high-quality parts for Chevy Duramax, Ford Powerstroke, and Dodge Cummins </span><a href=""https://usdieselparts.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">diesel trucks</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, we&rsquo;ve got you covered with the best options available in the US.

"9941","Diesel Truck Modding: Four Upgrade Parts You Can Install Yourself","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you&rsquo;re a diesel enthusiast and own a truck that you think needs some modding, perhaps it is time to partake in some DIY modding. You might be able to throw these mods in as a way to bond with your children because they&rsquo;ve likely been just spending your hard-earned money on video game purchases. Give them useful life skills, and perhaps convert them into your very own petrolheads whom you can one day hand down your sick diesel truck to. Be warned though, diesel truck modding is a money pit and will likely suck you (and your kids) in, so here is our guide to four upgrades you can conduct by yourself with some help:</span></p>
<h2><strong>Cold Air Intake Kits</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is the most simple, yet extremely effective mod piece for any diesel engine. With your engine gasping for air on a regular basis trying to power through, cold air intake gives it a breath of fresh air and adds a slight increase in horsepower and overall performance. So grab your kids off their iPads and hand them a wrench, because this kit can be installed by anyone of any age.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Most intake kits on the market just bolt onto your engine without any drilling necessary or any permanent and irreversible modifications. Even if you are new to installing these yourself, this is a great first mod to study on and get comfortable with installing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We give this part a 1/5 in the difficulty scale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Tuner &amp; Programming Chips</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is normally a plug-and-play component that attaches right into the OBDII port under the dashboard and can reprogram the way your ECU runs. You will be able to choose if it runs using a performance mode or a power-saving mode. Depending on the model, it attaches to either the dash or the windshield to make on the fly changes, but if not, it can be placed in the glove box for tweaking down the road.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We give this a 0/5 in the difficulty scale because this is just something you plug into your car&rsquo;s OBDII port and press some buttons.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Suspension Systems</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This includes the installation of new shocks, strut bars, and coilovers. If you normally take your truck off-road, chances are that your suspension system will receive some form of damage and rust, especially if they are stock and left uncleaned. Bolts are likely to rust and the suspension may feel softer at some point, so take note of these because this means you need to start changing them out.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While this may seem complicated, just remember that you need a spring compressor to safely strip apart the shock absorber with the coilover. There are also suspension systems that come in a package, so all you need to do is pull out the old system and slap in the new one without a need for a spring compressor. This is a great upgrade to make, and can easily be done by yourself with the help from your son or daughter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We rate this upgrade a 3/5 in difficulties due to the need for a spring compressor and the potential dangers if not done properly. Remember that coilovers are compressed springs, and when stripped improperly, these things can fly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Catback Exhaust Kits + Headers</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Catback kits are mostly bolt-on with clamps and v-bands which mount to the retrofitted exhaust hangars. If you are installing a whole new custom exhaust system, you may need the help of a shop to conduct welding. These can mostly be done in one afternoon if planned right.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The difficulty of this depends on your car&rsquo;s model. Some cars just simply need a few bolts and an afternoon, while others are complex and require removing multiple parts to attach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Car modding is a good skill to have, and can make your diesel truck run even better than ever. It can also get your kids off the couch this summer and get their hands dirty with modding your truck. With these performance enhancers, you can even start taking them off-roading and into the mountains for a nice trip to see the local scenery. So start modding your truck today!</span></p>

"9942","3 Ways to Get More Power Out of Your Diesel Truck Engine","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you get your diesel trucks for the first time, it seems like no feeling can ever get better than strolling around town, hauling any load, and climbing rocks. Over time, however, you&rsquo;ll probably start to notice that there&rsquo;s an itch for improvement and an urge to boost your truck&rsquo;s performance as you spot more aspects that need to be tweaked.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After a few months, the pull you were once amazed at first will start to feel lacking in some way to the point that it feels like it pales in comparison to how much power the engine can actually put out. Among all the different ways to improve or upgrade your truck, there&rsquo;s one idea that may move faster and speak louder than the rest: </span><strong>improving your diesel engine&rsquo;s </strong><strong><em>performance.</em></strong></p>
<h2><strong>How you can start tweaking for better numbers</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The truth about getting easily dissatisfied with a stock diesel truck is that it&rsquo;s just as easy as taking charge of your machine and tweaking it for boosted power ratings.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fortunately, turning your truck into a beast is an effortless experience when you know what little details to tinker around with and which parts to invest in. If you&rsquo;ve been looking to make the most out of the strong, iron-block-clad beast under the hood without having to buy a new truck entirely, here are a few ways you can follow:</span></p>
<h3><strong>Idea #1: </strong><strong><em>Swap out your stock internals for performance air filters and cold air intakes</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the most effective, yet unsuspecting ways to improve a diesel truck&rsquo;s performance ratings is to invest in aftermarket cold air intake kits and air filters.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While the idea of air may not seem like such a vital concept in relation to performance, the reality is that having an improved system that knows what to do with the wind your truck&rsquo;s taking in will make a difference in your driving experience. By investing in new filters and systems, you&rsquo;ll be able to stream air effectively to maximize the power and air-to-fuel ratios in your pistons to get better combustion, all while preserving optimal fuel economy!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span></p>
<h3><strong>Idea #2: </strong><strong><em>Upgrade your fuel injectors</em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Speaking of fuel, another great way to improve the overall performance of your diesel engine is to look at the very part responsible for supplying your truck&rsquo;s heart with its fuel: </span><strong>The fuel injectors.</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By upgrading your diesel fuel injectors with an aftermarket option that features various upgraded functions, you can significantly boost the power ratings of your engine. This seemingly-simple upgrade will improve your engine to the point where it can add up to 100 horsepower after a few adjustments and a tune!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><strong>Tip #3: </strong><strong><em>Install or upgrade your turbocharger</em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Today, modern diesel engine options heavily rely on a turbocharger to draw in more power to fly, making it essential to have one and improve it over time for better performance. With the help of a top-notch turbo in place, you can push more air into your engine to further boost the overall power ratings it churns out!</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you aren&rsquo;t satisfied with the power that your diesel truck is making, there&rsquo;s no need to worry because there is an abundance of different options that you can start working with. By starting off with the three tips mentioned above, however, you can make significant gains in no time!</span><strong><br /></strong></p>

"9943","Own A Diesel Truck? Here Are Six Parts You Must Invest In","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So you own a diesel truck, and we are sure you own one for a good reason. The feeling of incredible torque, longevity, and amazing fuel economy that a diesel engine delivers massively outweighs that of your standard gasoline engine. Not only that, but owning a truck means you can go far more places than a standard econobox can go, and haul even more heavy items and equipment, too. Why sell short and limit your options when you can have an all-around vehicle that is extremely fuel-efficient, right?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here at US Diesel Parts, we have compiled a shortlist of some of our favorite upgrade accessories and performance parts that&rsquo;ll give your truck even more oomph. Without further ado, here&rsquo;s what we have to say about what to add to your truck based on our expertise on the platform:</span></p>
<h2><strong>Air Filters &amp; Intake Systems</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Remember that engines need air to assist it in hauling you down the highway, so with each chug and rattle, your diesel engine is begging for air. Replacing your retrofitted intake tubes and filters with cold air intakes and a performance filter will do many great things to the performance of your truck.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some of these performance boosts include increased horsepower, torque and fuel economy, as well as having washable filters saving you money on replacement factory paper filters. Your engine bay will also look extremely stylish with aftermarket specialized nylon and metal tubes compared to the standard plastic ones that come stock.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Exhaust Systems</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While most people think that the rumble and growl of an engine should be reserved for hypercars and race cars, why would you want to confine the beast of an engine in your truck? The factory exhaust is restrictive and sounds quiet and tiny like it would in a compact sedan. Like other performance parts, a good exhaust system that includes upgraded mufflers and tips increases the total horsepower and adds a performance tone to your vehicle.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Performance Chips</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The best upgrade that not many people invest in is performance chips that noticeably improve performance. Using software and technology, you can easily become the &ldquo;diesel whisperer&rdquo; and program your truck the way you want it to run. While the factory models come set in one setting, chips give you all the power at your fingertips. Whether you want to run your truck with top power or with better fuel economy and setting top speed limits and shifting points, performance chips can give you all that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Suspension Systems</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you are one of those people who lifts heavy loads with your truck, these loads put stress on stock suspensions. When this happens, it causes damage over time and makes your ride less stable. By upgrading the suspension, you can take your truck off-road and haul even more items with more comfort and ease.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Trailer Hitches &amp; Towing</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Having a high-quality trailer hitch and a towing system allows you to safely haul things like trailers and boats, which is what you will want knowing that these items cost a lot. A heavy-duty tow hook will not only be functional but also gives your truck a badass look</span></p>
<h2><strong>Gauges</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While diesel engines are extremely durable, placing more boost using turbo and superchargers can cause extreme stress. When your diesel truck is putting out more power, it means more work on the engine&rsquo;s part to keep running. A set of gauges that monitor power, oil levels, and temperatures can help keep your truck in one piece.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Upgrading your truck is a fun experience, and is normally very rewarding. Remember that your truck is an investment that costs thousands of dollars, which means you will want to put only the highest quality parts in it. Keep your truck looking badass and running smoothly by purchasing some of these mod parts because trust us, you won&rsquo;t regret it.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you are a lucky owner of a truck with a </span><a href=""https://usdieselparts.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">diesel engine</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, US Diesel Parts has the widest selection of upgrade and performance parts to give your truck an edge.

"9936","A Beginner Driver's Guide to Diesel Engine Fuel Injectors","<p><strong>Fuel injectors: </strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">for most diesel truck owners (or automotive enthusiasts) this particular component finds itself at the top of the hierarchy of importance as opposed to other parts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether you&rsquo;re an avid fan, an expert, or a complete beginner, you&rsquo;re most likely going to be familiar with this part because of how important it is. As vital as this component may be, however, it&rsquo;s also understandable to have some unawareness over it if you&rsquo;ve only started to get into diesel trucks now.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While you may be concerned about not knowing what this part is, what it does, or how it works, there&rsquo;s no need to worry because everyone has to start somewhere eventually. If you want to know more about fuel injectors, we&rsquo;ve put together this helpful guide to get up to speed:</span></p>
<h2><strong>Fuel injectors explained</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br /></strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This part is a component that is located within an engine&rsquo;s fuel delivery system which is responsible for supplying its pistons with a constant supply of gas for it to operate.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By using calculated patterns and electronically-controlled timing apparatuses, fuel injectors spray diesel into the piston area to help the engine achieve an optimal combustion ratio for improved performance. With newer engines, computers are used in junction with the injectors to optimize the amount of fuel sprayed for proper conservation and performance while queueing the timing of the injection itself to fractions of a second.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Are they prone to problems?</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Beyond their importance in any diesel engine assembly, another aspect of the components that anyone should get familiar with is their ability to fail, and what causes such problems to happen.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Just like any other component in a diesel truck, the fuel injectors are no exception when it comes to potential pitfalls and eventual bouts of failure over time. As opposed to most components, however, it&rsquo;s worth noting that injectors are not wear-and-tear items that get replaced often as they can last for as long as the vehicle itself does.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What causes them to fail in the first place?</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Generally, the fuel injectors in a diesel engine can end up failing because of several reasons that are either beyond a driver&rsquo;s control. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">These crucial parts experience failure in one way or another when they become packed with various contaminants (such as dirt or carbon buildup) that clog each of the injectors. Beyond contamination and debris, aging can also cause these parts to malfunction because the rubber and fiber components comprise the whole assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While cleaning may work to some extent for minor problems, the solution to most fuel injector-related problems is a complete replacement of the assembly to restore function and dependability!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Among all the different parts that comprise your diesel truck engine&rsquo;s assembly, none could possibly be more pivotal than the set of fuel injectors that ensure everything runs smoothly. By understanding the basic pieces of information about these parts, you&rsquo;ll be able to get a good idea of how important the part is and why you need to make sure your truck stays in tip-top shape all-year-round!</span></p>

"9937","3 Reasons Your Diesel Truck Needs an Aftermarket Steel Bumper","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the best vehicles to purchase and have in the modern age is a diesel engine truck. The beauty of a diesel engine is its fuel-efficiency, which when patterned with a truck&rsquo;s frame, makes it a great load-bearing behemoth. These impressive beasts are known for guzzling diesel fuel to power through the day and carry just about any load on just about any terrain.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As beautiful as the modern-day US diesel engine trucks created by Ford, Dodge, and Chevy are, these can always use a little bit more modification to truly personalize the experience. While many prefer adding lights, decals, or other aesthetic improvements, the most crucial is the addition of a steel bumper.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The Trouble With Factory Bumpers</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The design of the just about any truck is impressive&mdash;its size and load-bearing capacity are the biggest highlights here. Despite this, many truck owners don&rsquo;t realize that a simple bumper can destroy the entire image.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Factory bumpers, while definitely matching the rest of the car, aren&rsquo;t as impressive as it should be. As the literal head of your truck, these should be capable of protecting your car&rsquo;s exterior&mdash;which is unfortunately not something a regular factory bumper can provide easily. In order to fix this, it&rsquo;s highly recommended to go for an aftermarket steel bumper instead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The Benefits of A Steel Bumper</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As soon as you get your diesel engine truck running, the first improvement you should be looking to would be the addition of a steel bumper. To cement this point, here are three major reasons why it&rsquo;s the most important addition you can make for your truck.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>It&rsquo;s Incredibly Aesthetic</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Steel bumpers are amazing structures. Their design, while incredibly simple and seemingly plain, makes for a strong &ldquo;face&rdquo; for your beloved new truck. This one addition can shout to your neighbors just how serious and strong your vehicle needs to be to keep up with your lifestyle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>It&rsquo;s Excessively Durable</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The most important factor of a bumper is durability&mdash;and a steel bumper will not disappoint. Almost nothing can leave a dent on this piece of metal, and if it does, a little buffing and paint can fix it up right away.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Steel, in itself, is a durable material. Heavy impacts won&rsquo;t easily break them, and even if something does leave a dent, it won&rsquo;t be a structural issue to keep it on.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>It&rsquo;s Open For More Modifications</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The best additional benefit that a steel bumper can provide is the leeway it gives for more functional modifications for your diesel truck. A majority of steel bumpers have pre-cut holes for the most basic additions to a truck, such as a winch or new fog lamps&mdash;one factor that factory bumpers simply can&rsquo;t provide.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A US diesel engine truck is only as functional as the body that encases it. By adding an aftermarket steel bumper at first chance, you can ensure that it can face any challenge without folding. Through this, you can assure that your truck&rsquo;s face remains strong and durable, no matter what obstacle it meets on the open road.</span></p>

"9938","6 Ways to Maintain Your Diesel Engine - What to Know","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Driving and owning a vehicle comes with a lot of responsibilities. A vehicle is a machine with a lot of moving components, any one of which can go wrong if improperly maintained. Diesel engines are no different, and present many of their own maintenance concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As with anything, an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure, and there are ways you can maintain your diesel engine that can help it run better, last longer, and break down less.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are some of these ways:</span></p>
<h2><strong> Observe your fluid levels.</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Engine oil is what keeps the mechanical components of your diesel engine lubricated and operating smoothly. Without it, the surfaces would scrape against each other painfully and degrade the engine over a short period of time. Check it at least once a month, and if possible, more often.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your engine coolant also needs your regular attention and is just as important as the oil. Regularly topping up your engine coolant can prevent overheating, coolant freezing, and engine-damaging electrolysis in your cylinder liners.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Keep your engine (and your truck) clean.</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are all sorts of ways to dirty a truck&mdash;soot, grime, dirt, etc. But keeping your truck clean can help you keep an eye out issues regularly before they become serious problems. It&rsquo;s easier to identify, for example, when a truck has been leaking oil if the truck and the surrounding area are clean.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dirty radiators and intercoolers can also mess with your diesel engine&rsquo;s overall performance. Just like with the human body, keeping it clean just keeps it healthier.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Maintain your radiator.</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A dysfunctional radiator can cause your engine to overheat. Past a certain heat level, your diesel engine will become irreparable. You&rsquo;ll have to replace the entire engine if that happens.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A radiator helps your diesel engine by cooling it, and therefore should be an essential part of your upkeep. Radiators should be regularly cleaned, the coolant in them should be regularly tested, and radiators should be replaced every couple of years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong> Change your filters regularly.</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fuel filters should be replaced regularly to ensure a better flow of fuel throughout the entire system. Much like the heart, fuel filters build up grime over time, eventually hampering the flow of fuel or even clogging it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A fully clogged fuel filter can prevent an engine from running at all and can make your truck operate at inefficient levels, running too slowly and heating up too quickly.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Familiarize yourself with the symptoms of an unhealthy diesel engine.</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Frequent drivers should know from the sound of the car alone when something is wrong with it. Is there a clicking noise? Is it rumbling at a higher or lower register? Is there something off about turning the wheel to the left?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Any unfamiliar noises are cause for concern and could mean repairs or maintenance is needed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong> Protect your exhaust system.</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As diesel engines developed over the years, so too did the exhaust systems that accompanied them. There are also EPA standards to meet, that involve the regular topping up of Diesel Exhaust Fluids (DEF) and cleaning of Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">DPF regeneration is something you have to pay attention to, in case the particulates caught in the filter, it will heat up to the point of combustion, producing ash and carbon dioxide. If regeneration is a regular problem, you may have to consult a technician.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your DEF tank also needs to be regularly refilled, as an empty can reduce performance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your vehicle is an investment and an important part of life. For many, their trucks are associated with their livelihoods and are a tool for providing income so that they can provide for their families. Proper diesel engine maintenance can help your car not only operate better but last longer.&nbsp;</span></p>

"9939","3 Turbocharger Care Tips Every Diesel Truck Owner Should Know About","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To the budding diesel truck enthusiast, one of the most exciting parts of the ownership experience is also one that may seem pretty basic: turbocharger installation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you&rsquo;ve had a diesel truck for a while now, then you&rsquo;re probably familiar with the excitement we&rsquo;re talking about. As opposed to most engines available in the market today, diesel engines are exciting to truck enthusiasts because of how customizable and tuneable they are when it comes to turbochargers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For a few hundred dollars, you can instantly transform your humble rig into a mini speed demon with the help of a top-quality turbo option that&rsquo;s as affordable as it is powerful. Before you go all-out on your build and get turbo set up, however, it&rsquo;s important to remember that the struggle doesn&rsquo;t stop once you&rsquo;ve got it installed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Given the intricacies of the parts in question, failing to exert or exhibit the necessary amount of care during maintenance and use can yield disastrous results that will set you back thousands of dollars. Fortunately, making sure your turbocharger (and engine) lasts long after installation simply requires that you approach it correctly!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Turbo care tips well worth considering</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now that you&rsquo;ve got a hotshot turbocharger installed under your diesel truck&rsquo;s hood, here are some expert-endorsed tips that you can start practicing to keep the system running smoothly:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Turbo tip #1: </strong><strong><em>Clean your boost components on a regular basis</em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What many American turbo diesel engine truck owners overlook more often than they should is the responsibility of cleaning their boost tubes and intercoolers when needed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although they may not seem like the most significant components in the world, both the boost components play a significant role in making sure that everything runs smoothly. Failing to clean both your tubes and intercooler can result in catastrophic levels of engine damage. This is because it can mess up the air feeding process and feed foreign items into the turbine. You could find yourself with a damaged turbo that requires a complete replacement!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fortunately, getting your crucial turbo components cleaned and keeping your engine out of harm&rsquo;s way is simple when you clean them on a regular basis.</span></p>
<p><strong>Turbo tip #2: </strong><strong><em>Watch out for cracked and worn boost hoses and tubes</em></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For any kind of turbocharged diesel engine, the hoses and tubes installed are just as important as the spool snail itself. This means that it&rsquo;s vital to carry out replacements once they begin showing signs of wear and tear.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Keeping your boost tubes and hoses in peak condition at all times is absolutely essential because failing to do so puts you at risk of boost leaks. You could find yourself with a damaged thrust bearing that requires a full replacement. By taking the time to routinely inspect your turbocharger set-up, replace hoses and tubes when needed, and make sure that everything&rsquo;s nice and clamped, however, you can drive worry-free!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><strong>Turbo tip #3: </strong><strong><em>Partner your turbo installation with an oil change and filter replacement</em></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When a new turbocharger is installed, most truck owners are oblivious to the fact that they run the risk of air restrictions and oil contamination issues that result from old, dirty filters. Simply by replacing your engine oil, swapping out your engine filter, and replacing your air filter, you can prevent any problems from popping up!</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While they are powerful components that show off the diesel engine&rsquo;s true capabilities, turbochargers are delicate pieces of technology that need to be taken care of to ensure continuous performance and no fuss. With the tips mentioned above, you can keep everything running smoothly and make sure your turbo lasts as long as possible with minimal maintenance!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to </span><a href=""https://usdieselparts.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">parts for Chevy Duramax, Dodge Cummins, and Ford Powerstroke diesel trucks</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, we&rsquo;ve got you covered with the largest supply of components on American soil.

"9932","Towing Your Diesel 101: 3 Simple Tips For Beginners","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It&rsquo;s no secret that Diesel engines are designed to generate more torque, which is why their commercial and heavy-duty trucks are often the cream of the crop in the auto industry for its towing and hauling capabilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even with an impressionable engine that can guarantee a stress-free drive, there are still critical steps you need to know to ensure a safer towing experience. With that in mind, the tips below should help you steer away from potential mistakes and roadblocks along the way:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Tip #1: Hook It Up Using the Right Hitches and Ball Size</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The first step is to hook the two-strap or chain securely to each end of your vehicle to attach the load. Keep in mind that the chains should never drag on the ground, so be sure to adjust it to the appropriate length.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As for the hitches, there are different levels of weight that vary according to what you need to tow, such as the following:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Class 1: Up to 2,000 pounds</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Class 2: Up to 3,500 pounds</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Class 3: Up to 8,000 pounds</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Class 4: Up to 10,000 pounds</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Class 5: Up to 12,000 pounds</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The weight of the trailer will also influence the ball size, wherein it should always exceed the capacity of a loaded trailer. Keep in mind that the hitch ball is an integral safety gear as it supports some of the trailer&rsquo;s weight, which helps maintain control over the truck.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Tip #2: Always Consider the Trailer Load Balance&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ensuring that the trailer load is stable is crucial to a smooth-sailing ride carrying a massive weight. It can help keep the vehicles in proper alignment, making each movement predictable, especially when handling curves or corners.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With that in mind, most manufacturers recommend that at least 60 percent of the weight of the trailer&rsquo;s load should be spread with the trailer&rsquo;s front half to maintain a balance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Tip #3: Always Opt For Safety Chains&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even with a highly secure attachment between the ball and tongue of the truck, opting for safety chains can boost security by ensuring the trailer and hitch remain fastened together. In that regard, don&rsquo;t forget to use the right length that is enough to handle turns and twists without hitting the pavement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The Bottom Line: The Importance of Choosing the Right Equipment and Weight Compatibility When Towing a Truck</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The massive amount of torque in Diesel engines enables it to smoothly carry heavy loads, other trucks, or trailers across hills and gain speed even with a forceful headwind. The best part is that its impressive turbocharge is matched with an equally efficient fuel economy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Towing a trailer and other heavy cargo requires plenty of practice and preparation, but the tips above should clue you in on the basics to ensure you can tow away without running into trouble on the road.&nbsp;</span></p>

"9933","5 Reasons You Should Invest In Diesel Fuel Additives","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Poor quality diesel fuels at gas stations don&rsquo;t always follow the best standards for gas, which creates different complications to your vehicle due to fuel-related issues. These can range from minor issues like slow acceleration idling time to more severe damages like fuel icing and poor lubricity. Using a diesel fuel additive keeps you from dealing with these problems while it also provides several benefits for your engine&rsquo;s shelf life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The advantages of using high-quality diesel fuel</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If your car is suffering from excess smoke or fuel, the common culprit may be the presence of poor diesel fuel. Investing in a high-quality diesel fuel additive will prevent you from suffering the different issues that it can give to your vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this article, we will share five reasons using a diesel fuel additive can help prolong your diesel engine&rsquo;s life span:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong> It lubricates your vehicle's fuel injection system</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One essential requirement for newer emissions regulations is ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. However, these policies also result in hydrodesulfurization (HDS) that makes diesel fuel lose its lubricity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Know that lubricity is vital in preventing your engine&rsquo;s components from wear and tear. Having low levels will cause your high-pressure pumps and fuel injectors to have a shorter service life. Fuel additives, such as XFP&rsquo;s Diesel Power Plus, prevents the issues of low lubricity by coating the fuel system&rsquo;s internal parts to produce less friction for better fuel flow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong> It cleanses your fuel systems and injectors</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fuel additives contain a formulated detergent to aid in the flushing out of hard deposits that build up in your tank. Decarbonization, in particular, helps in repairing common issues, such as engine hesitation and rough idling. By removing the excess carbon, your engine will be able to improve diesel performance while contributing to better fuel efficiency at the same time.</span></p>
<h3><strong> It improves cetane ratings</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Diesel engines require a specific cetane number (CN) to operate correctly. This can range from a rating of 40 &ndash; 45 for American brands compared to global numbers that can reach up to 55.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In many states, the ASTM D975 dictates that diesel fuel standard be set at 40.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Modern diesel engines run at their best with a value above 48 for maximum efficiency. Fuel additives can increase an engine&rsquo;s cetane to increase horsepower and start-up speeds while it reduces emission volumes and provide smoother transitions from idling to acceleration.</span></p>
<h3><strong> It reduces smoke while increasing fuel economy</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A vehicle&rsquo;s CN is a measure of its engine&rsquo;s combustion efficiency. The higher the number is, the better chances that fuel droplets that land on the combustion chamber produce power. Higher chances of fuel-burning lead to fewer instances of smoke production. This doesn&rsquo;t only reduce your volume of exhaust that your vehicle generates, but it also gives better fuel mileage per tank.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong> It prevents fuel icing and freeze-ups</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Diesel fuel tends to freeze up during cold seasons. The low temperature causes the fuel filters to be plugged with wax and ice. Although this is only a minor inconvenience, it can cause significant permanent damage to your engine if left unattended or unused for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Diesel fuel additives are excellent solutions to prevent icing in your tanks because tailor-fit formulas, such as the XDP Polar-D Winter Formula, can keep your engine warm to prevent your fuel from freezing during cold seasons.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Improving your engine&rsquo;s life span is necessary to make sure that you get the most mileage out of your vehicle. You should remember that the best way to deal with auto problems is by preventing your car from experiencing them in the first place.</span></p>

"9934","Why You Should Invest in New Fuel Injectors for Your Truck","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For any diesel truck, the engine will perform as well as it possibly can if it&rsquo;s supplied with all the right parts. Whether it is the simple details like spark plugs and timing belts or major components like refurbished blocks and overhauled drivetrains, every piece plays a crucial part in improving your vehicle&rsquo;s performance. It is for this reason that many enthusiasts, experts, and shop owners place importance on having premium parts at all times.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For most drivers on a budget, however, getting new parts all the time isn&rsquo;t the most feasible way to approach the problem, which is why many people go for a mix of remanufactured or refurbished, and new options in their engine. While other parts may yield a specific level of satisfactory performance when installed as a refurbished variant, there&rsquo;s one component that works best brand new: </span><strong>fuel injectors.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Refurbished and remanufactured fuel injectors</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Just like other parts that are comprised of multiple pieces, fuel injectors also hold the potential to be tinkered reworked as refurbished and remanufactured options.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mostly geared to cost-conscious diesel truck owners, other versions of this essential component offer a cheaper alternative for repair when wear and tear set in after extended use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Refurbished options are generally distinguishable from their new and remanufactured counterparts because they are created by taking injectors off from old engines, cleaning and testing them, and sold after meeting OEM specifications. On the other hand, remanufactured variants are created by taking a pre-used or defective product apart, replacing broken components, cleaning everything up, and piecing everything together to be sold again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Why you should invest in new fuel injectors instead</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although the bargain that comes with alternative options can be quite tempting at times, there are several reasons you should opt for new fuel injectors instead. Here are two reasons for you to consider:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>Fuel injectors aren&rsquo;t the best parts when it comes to second-hand use</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While there is nothing wrong with getting second-hand parts for the meantime, fuel injectors aren&rsquo;t exactly the best place to cheapen out because they take quite a beating with regular use. This extended use means that &ldquo;pre-loved&rdquo; variants aren&rsquo;t dependable and can easily break down.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With new fuel injectors, however, the main distinction to watch out for is that you&rsquo;re guaranteed a longer period of use because you&rsquo;re getting a product right off the factory line. Instead of troubling yourself with used parts under the hood, you can go on trips with a sense of relief over the fact that your engine won&rsquo;t unexpectedly fail on you!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /><br /></span></p>
<h3><strong><em>New fuel injectors come with extended warranty</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Just like other parts, you can&rsquo;t exactly tell when fuel injectors will fail on you,&nbsp;leaving you prone to spending a fortune if a refurbished or remanufactured option fails. As opposed to the significantly shorter warranty policies that these options bear, new fuel injectors have a far lengthier coverage and will save your money in the long run if you&rsquo;re smart enough to invest in them!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Aside from the fact that they&rsquo;re new, brand-new fuel injectors are worth every penny you invest in them because they have better warranty policies and perform the way they should. While many other parts in your diesel truck can be substituted for refurbished or remanufactured options, fuel injectors are better when they&rsquo;re new and will always stay that way, so invest wisely!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /><br /></span></p>

"9935","3 Things You Can Do to Keep Your Diesel Engine Healthy","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While diesel engines are designed to be tough and durable, just like any other engine out there, they still need sufficient maintenance and care to ensure that they continue running for a long time. Taking the necessary steps to keep it in great condition will help save costs and reduce any risk of the engine running into trouble while you are on the road.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether you are driving a diesel truck or car, here are some things you can do to keep your engine healthy:</span></p>
<h2><strong> Replace the fuel filters</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A fuel filter purifies the fuel that powers the engine. When pulled into the engine, the fuel will also carry any debris and particles that might be present with them. Without a filter, the particles can cause a lot of damage to the engine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As the filters keep debris and particles out of the engine, they can be clogged over time. This means that, eventually, you will have to replace them. Note, however, that not all filters are alike. Some will last a lot longer than others, so be sure to check the estimated lifetime of the product and opt for the one that can last a long time.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Maintain the cooling system</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since your engine burns fuel, it tends to get hot while running your vehicle. Sometimes, the heat can be too much that without a proper cooling system, the engine might overheat. For this reason, you must always maintain your engine cooling system working properly.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How do you do this? The best thing you can do is to replace the coolant in the system once in a while. That makes the engine cooling system gets to work with clean and efficient coolants, ensuring that it can effectively keep the temperatures in check.</span></p>
<h2><strong> Install an adjustable fuel pressure regulator</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many vehicles today come with what is known as a fuel injection system, also called FIS. The FIS, particularly in its fuel pressure regulator, controls how much fuel enters your engine, which can affect its performance.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have a FIS system in your vehicle, then we recommend replacing the regulator with an adjustable version. That way, you can accurately set how much fuel will be pumped into the engine. It also allows for any extra fuel to be sent straight back into the fuel tank, allowing for zero wasted fuel.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Keep in mind the tips we have shared and apply them to your vehicle. That way, you can ensure that your diesel engine is well-maintained and will last for the longest time possible. Inspect it from time to time too so that you can catch any minor issues before they get worse. Moreover, whenever you look for new products for your engine, you should get them from a reputable company. Not only will they offer high-quality parts, but they will also provide you great advice and service to ensure your vehicle is in tip-top condition.</span></p>

"9928","3 Guaranteed Ways to Improve Your Diesel Engine Performance","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With more than 40 available models in the US automotive market today, the diesel engines are some of the greatest American commodities aside from beers and guns.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thanks to their improved fuel economy, longevity, durability, and unhampered performance capabilities, the gasoline alternative has proved itself to be superior and worth the slight price increase. The main aspect with diesel engines that makes them special is that they&rsquo;re not only limited to what they are from the factory floor, but they also </span><strong>bear the potential to be improved for even better performance!</strong></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><strong>A few crucial tips to boost your diesel engine&rsquo;s capabilities</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fortunately, making the most out of your diesel engine and drawing in more power, performance, and durability isn&rsquo;t as complicated as you might expect. If you&rsquo;re looking to get a bang for your buck with your diesel engine in the long run, here are three effective tips that you can start following right away:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Tip #1: </strong><strong><em>Invest in a diesel performance exhaust</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Among all the different parts that you could possibly get for your diesel engine, none can make a bigger difference than a fine-tuned </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">diesel performance exhaust.</span></em></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As opposed to the stock pipes that pose a difficulty for engines to push out exhaust gases in the most efficient way, aftermarket pipes carry a more effective way to carry out combustion. With minimal bends and a 3.5-inch to 5-inch diameter, the standard performance exhaust helps a truck attain high flow while lowering the temperature the system experiences. This essentially makes the engine run better and last longer!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /><br /></span></p>
<h3><strong>Tip #2: </strong><strong><em>Upgrade your air intake kit</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In terms of airflow and increased performance, another key upgrade that&rsquo;s bound to do your engine much good is a proper upgraded air intake kit.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Generally, air intake kits help generate a significant increase in power ratings and performance numbers because they supplement the proprietary component of an engine&rsquo;s function: oxygen. By pulling in more oxygen into an engine compartment at a forced rate, the intake kit helps the cylinders to pump out more power with optimized compression rates, resulting in improved airflow that translates to performance!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /><br /></span></p>
<h3><strong>Tip #3: </strong><strong><em>Maintain your engine on a regular basis</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although they may be low-maintenance in nature as opposed to other options in the market, diesel engines still need proper servicing and maintenance works. This is especially true when it comes to keeping their performance up-to-par!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When improving your diesel engine, it goes without saying that maintenance will always be essential for any successful process at making it far better. With regular servicing, you can address any underlying issues that may be stripping your engine of torque and horsepower numbers while fine-tuning all the minor details for sustained operation!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to improving the overall performance of your diesel engine, it&rsquo;s vital to remember that enhanced performance can only be achieved when the right tips are considered. By taking the three tips mentioned above into mind, you&rsquo;ll be able to see significant improvements in your engine&rsquo;s overall power and performance in no time!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We&rsquo;re the leading </span><a href=""https://usdieselparts.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">diesel engine parts supplier in America</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that carries OEM and aftermarket parts for Ford Powerstroke, Chevy Duramax, and Dodge Cummins trucks.

"9929","4 Ways to Upgrade Your Diesel Car's Engine Performance","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As more and more people are purchasing diesel-powered vehicles, more and more people are looking for ways to increase the power of their engines. There are many reasons for this. For some, they want to increase their engine&rsquo;s efficiency so that they can travel greater distances with the same amount of fuel. For others, they want to enjoy the raw power that upgrades to their engine brings.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether you have the same reasons or not, upgrading your diesel engine&rsquo;s performance is generally advantageous. If you want to find out how you can do it, here are several options you can go for:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>1. Upgrade your air intake system</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All cars need to draw in air from the outside for the engine to run. This is because oxygen is required to ignite the fuel that provides power to the engine. As such, you can significantly increase your engine's performance by upgrading its air intake system. This will promote better airflow to the engine as well as ensure that cooler air can enter.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Other benefits of having an air intake include improved fuel efficiency, which is always a plus! It is an investment that will pay itself off with money saved on fuel and add more horsepower to your diesel-powered vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>2. Install turbochargers</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A turbocharger, also known as a turbo, works by forcefully pumping air into the engine. While this sounds like a glorified air intake system, it works differently by pressurizing the air. You can expect up to ten times the normal airflow with this upgrade, depending on type of turbo you use.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In any case, a turbocharger lets your engine use fuel at a much faster rate. This results in significantly higher power output, albeit for limited periods of time. As an added bonus, you get to enjoy the satisfying whistle sound once you engage the turbo.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>3. Swap out your exhausts</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While your exhausts will not necessarily directly add power to your car's engine, what it does is allow better airflow through the engine&rsquo;s system. As you already know, better airflow in and out of the engine means more power. If you love the roar of powerful vehicles, this is an upgrade you must consider.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>4. Upgrade your fuel injectors</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With better fuel injectors, more fuel can travel to the engine to pump those pistons faster. This doesn&rsquo;t mean, however, that you will be consuming much more fuel than normal. In fact, if you choose the right type, you might actually save on fuel.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some of the newer fuel injector models are equipped with unique nozzles that spray fuel as a very fine mist. This allows the engine to work more efficiently to ignite the fuel. At the same time, less fuel is consumed in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Any of the upgrades here can drastically boost your car's overall performance and enhance your fuel economy, which is a win-win in any situation. You can even apply all these upgrades at once, making your vehicle perform better in many ways!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>

"9930","4 Reasons You Always Need To Keep Your Fuel Tank Full","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One piece of advice that many drivers receive is to ensure that the fuel tank never runs empty. For one thing, an empty tank means a vehicle is pretty much useless. You won&rsquo;t be getting far if your car is running on fumes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, an empty fuel tank can be more than just a hindrance. It can actually damage your vehicle that leads to permanent problems later on. To demonstrate what we mean, here are the reasons you need to ensure your car&rsquo;s fuel tank is never empty:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>1. Prevent condensation</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Condensation takes place when cold water vapor comes into contact with a warmer surface. The same thing can happen in your tank, particularly in the space that is not occupied by fuel. This can lead to moisture that can damage the components and prevent your car from running optimally, something that is further aggravated in cold weather where the the moisture can freeze.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>2. Prevent fuel pump failure</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The electric fuel pump motor needs gasoline because it acts as a coolant to ensure proper operation. When your gas tank is low, the pump can suck in air, which can generate heat. Over time, the heat can cause wear to your fuel pump.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This can lead to several problems that affect the performance of your vehicle. One, you might find it difficult to get your engine going. Two, it can impede fuel efficiency, lowering your car&rsquo;s expected mileage. Three, it can increase the chances of your engine overheating, causing your car to stall while you are on the road.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3. Prevent rust &amp; dirt</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dirt and rust can get trapped in your fuel tank, and when you&rsquo;re running low on gas, these harmful elements can build up and block your fuel filter. When this happens, you&rsquo;re looking at potentially costly repairs that you want to avoid.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Moreover, the dirt can go into the fuel filter. When your engine shakes when you&rsquo;re sitting idle in your car, it could signify a build-up of dirt in your fuel filter. You can also find it difficult to start your vehicle or it might not start at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>4. Prevent unnecessary accidents</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Can you just imagine getting into an accident or finding yourself trapped in the middle of the night because you ran out of fuel? Allowing your fuel tank to run low is not practical, especially if your frequently traverse empty roads.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Keeping your fuel tanks full as much as possible is also for your safety and protection. You must remember that when an engine dies abruptly, brakes and power steering can also be lost, preventing you from using you car safely should you manage to get it to run.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are many reasons you may avoid filling your tank when it&rsquo;s low. It could be that you&rsquo;re running late or just too busy to remember. On the other hand, others do not fill their gas tank as a way to save more money.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The thing is, saving time and money this way will cost you more in the future when you encounter issues with your fuel parts or, worse, when you get into an accident. The next time your tank is low, fill it up right away.&nbsp;</span></p>

"9931","Intake Systems: A Guide to Cold Air & Short Ram Intake","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Buying an intake system to replace your car&rsquo;s factory component will lead you to choose one of two main options together with the various mods and attachments to improve your car&rsquo;s performance. Before you buy an intake system for your car, you need to decide whether you&rsquo;re looking to install a cold air or a short ram intake. Keep in mind that each one has its pros and cons depending on the variability that you&rsquo;re looking for in handling your vehicle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Comparing the two intake systems</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Knowing the difference between the two systems will allow you to make a better judgment of whether one or the other is more effective to use as an intake system for your vehicle. In the sections below, we will share a quick guide to the differences between cold air and short ram intake:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Cold air intake</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This system is mainly used to draw in cold air, which is where the name comes from. It&rsquo;s placed in the car&rsquo;s fender or around the engine, depending on its design and fitment. The system includes several pipes, which makes it more expensive and more challenging to install in a vehicle. Since this intake has more piping bends, manufacturers need to ensure that air/fuel ratios remain at a safe level.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With a cold air intake system, your car is less likely to be bothered by the presence of a radiator fan&rsquo;s heat. However, some setups place the system near the radiator fan so the heat might be sent right into your intake system, which can cause poor performance on your vehicle&rsquo;s handling.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Short ram intake</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">These intakes are one of the more popular options for intake systems in the market since they can comfortably replace your vehicle&rsquo;s factory intake with a smoother pipe and an open-element air filter. In terms of price, short ram intake systems cost considerably lower compared to cold air systems. Since it&rsquo;s a perfect fit to replace the factory intake system, it&rsquo;s easier to install and requires less horsepower and torque to operate.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some manufacturers don&rsquo;t include the option for cold air intake systems, which makes the short ram a default option for truck owners. Besides incompatibility with the design, some vehicles don&rsquo;t require the additional power of a cold air intake as it could also decrease power due to its mass airflow (MAF) sensor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Investing in intake scoops</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to intake scoops, the judgment on its effectiveness relies on its design and placement. Some race cars have intake scoops that receive air from the bottom of the vehicle or the front of the bumper. This allows for more cool air to reach your air filter, which generates higher levels of power. Ram systems work in the same principle by directing air to your filter, which essentially turns your regular factory intake into a cold air intake with the addition of intake scoops.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Knowing heating and ventilation options</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Intake systems in the market offer heat shields to block off engine heat to prevent them from reaching a short ram&rsquo;s open-element air filter. However, not all models have this option. Some short ram intakes systems include a performance airbox. This addition promotes a higher airflow compared to a stock airbox and allows your vehicle&rsquo;s air filter to receive higher volumes of air. Air boxes are excellent for engine bays that can&rsquo;t have a heat shield installed or deal with the issue of hot air delivered through the engine compartment by a radiator fan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Besides looking at the intake system you&rsquo;ll use, you also need to be wary about its materials. Heat soak occurs when your intake piping heats up too much that hot air is sent through your engine, decreasing its performance. A well-made intake system is built from sturdy materials like aluminum, which prevents it from sending hot air by having a durable piping system.</span></p>

"9924","5 Correct Ways to Break in Your Brand New Car - Our Guide","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you get a brand new car, you might be tempted to drive it around too much, too fast, too soon. After all, this is your worthwhile investment, and you have all the reasons to get excited. However, pushing your diesel engine way too hard and putting your car parts under excess strain early on could cause repercussions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Manufacturers recommend breaking in your new car to maintain a good fuel economy, ensure that the moving parts work together properly, improve small diesel engine performance, and potentially extend your vehicle&rsquo;s lifespan. It involves driving and maintaining it in a specific way using certain techniques for some time to help it adjust and operate to various driving conditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are some techniques to break in your new car properly:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Accelerate gently</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Flooring the accelerator of your vehicle aggressively can be tempting. It&rsquo;s normal to want to discover what your car is capable of, especially when it is brand new. However, doing so can put your cylinders and engine oil to extreme pressure. It is best to accelerate gently, to ensure smooth engine performance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Maximize your safety when driving</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Breaking in your brand new car requires giving not only your engine time to fully adjust but also the various parts of your vehicle to settle in, which includes your brakes, tires, and suspension. Therefore, you need to drive as carefully and as cautiously as you can, especially for the first 200 miles. Your car parts will start to fully bed in and work better together after at least 1,000 miles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Prevent your engine from pushing too hard</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Forcing your engine to the red line can push your cylinders and piston rings to their limits. To ensure safety and prevent any damage, drive only up to 4,000 RPM in the first 1,000 miles of driving.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Give your engine enough time to warm up</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Driving your brand new car for short trips is a bad idea because cold engines have to work harder. What you can do is to use your new vehicle only when you are going on a long drive to avoid putting a strain on your oil delivery cycle. Doing this also ensures that your engine has been given enough time to warm up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Avoid towing heavy loads</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Getting a new car might mean that you can now go on road trips with your friends and loved ones more conveniently. You might feel excited to finally travel and hit the road along with your travel trailer, but you must keep in mind that towing heavy loads on your brand new car will put added strain on your engine. It is best to give your engine some time to adjust and hitch up your caravan only after 1,000 miles of driving.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Driving your car fast on an open road might be one of the best feelings ever, but this can pose potential problems over time if your vehicle is brand new. To ensure optimum engine health, make sure to give your car enough time to adjust to everyday driving conditions by breaking it in.</span></p>

"9925","4 Signs There's Something Wrong With Your Car's Turbocharger","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Of the most sought after yet most misunderstood parts of any car, the turbocharger must be on top of the list. If you do not know what a turbocharger (turbo) is, it is a device that utilizes turbines to pump the engine full of compressed air to maximize the engine's efficiency. With that said, the turbocharger is also one part of the car that is likely to run into problems.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have a turbocharger installed, you must know the signs of a problematic turbocharger to ensure that you get it fixed as soon as possible.</span></p>
<h2><strong> The boost gauge does not work</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many turbocharger installations come with a boost gauge that will help you track how much power you are receiving when the turbo is active. However, if you find that the indicator either does not display the proper readings or that the gauge does not respond at all, it could be either a problem with the turbo or the boost gauge itself. Either way, send your car in to have the turbocharger checked thoroughly.</span></p>
<h2><strong> The turbocharger makes an unusual sound</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have been driving with a turbocharger for a while, you will know how it typically sounds when active. This means that the moment it makes weird noises, you will be able to notice it immediately.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you catch your turbocharger making unusual sounds when active, have it checked. If you hear a loud whining noise from the turbo, then you will absolutely have to send the car for a fix right away. There could be a problem with the turbine or something related to the turbo that could potentially damage other parts of your car.</span></p>
<h2><strong> The exhaust smokes blue or grey</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Older cars will generally produce smoke the moment they start or as they run due to dirty filters and the like. However, if you notice smoke coming out only when you step on the pedal to accelerate or see a smoke plume when you start the car, it might be because your turbocharger has a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Often, the cause of this smoke is due to a crack in the turbine that causes oil to leak into the exhaust. This fluid eventually gets heated and emitted as smoke.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong> The engine warning light is on</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If the engine warning lights light up, this could mean that something is wrong with your turbo. We say ""could"" because the engine's diagnostic system covers a wide range of problems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For that reason, when you do see the light go on, you will need to bring the car in for further analysis and testing to locate the source of the issue.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you discover any of the problematic signs above, then you need to send your car to a mechanic and have it checked right away. Even if it is not the turbocharger's problem, it does not change the fact that there is something wrong with the car and that you need to have it fixed. Failure to do so can put you at risk of requiring a more expensive repair job as the problem goes bigger. More importantly, the problem can pose a danger to your safety as well as that of others on the road.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Tip #1: Improve the Engine&rsquo;s Air Intake&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Upgrading the engine&rsquo;s air intake is a fool-proof way of elevating the performance of a diesel vehicle. This is because more airflow means the engine can create more power, which can provide an impressionable horsepower for miles on end.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not to mention, swapping your old airflow kit with the latest models means the part will start to draw air from the outside, bringing with it colder air. This will fire up your engine further since cold air is denser, which means it contains more oxygen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Tip #2: Upgrade Your Fuel Injectors&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another way to boost your vehicle&rsquo;s power is to upgrade the fuel injectors. This can work in conjunction with the new airflow by enabling your engine to burn more fuel, leading to a jump in horsepower.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This comes with a single injector nozzle, which is designed to intensify the pressure for a better way of atomizing the fuel. As a result, you can gain a speedier performance along with an enhanced fuel economy to boot.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Tip #3: Update the Engine Control Module (ECM)</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another update that can complement your new air intake is the ECM. It&rsquo;s responsible for the engine's critical aspects, such as the air-fuel mixture and maximum RPM, making it a significant feature that can make or mar the engine&rsquo;s performance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Replacing or reprogramming the ECM can change the settings and adjust it according to your needs. This leaves more room to cater to horsepower, torque, and overall diesel efficiency for the rest of your ride.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Tip #4: Upgrade the Exhaust System&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While the list above is all about boosting your diesel vehicle&rsquo;s horsepower, you need to accompany the upgrades with an exhaust system that can cater to your engine&rsquo;s current performance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The larger the horsepower, the more volume of exhaust it needs to expel, so you need to match your improvements with an equally powerful exhaust system suitable for bigger capacity. This ensures your diesel truck can do its job on the road as smoothly as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>The Bottom Line&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Investing in some aftermarket, diesel engine mod parts can do wonders in bringing new life to your old truck. It can enhance performance and boost fuel efficiency, allowing you to ride a truck that feels faster, stronger, and more efficient for years to come.&nbsp;</span></p>

"9927","3 Signs that Your Diesel Truck's Fuel Injectors Need to Be Serviced Soon","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Best known as the heartbeat of any diesel engine, fuel injectors are one of the most important parts of your entire assembly because of their primary purpose in ensuring that a truck&rsquo;s wheels get to run as they should.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Just like any other kind of car part, however, fuel injectors aren&rsquo;t exempt from experiencing their own wear and tear over time as they are susceptible to their own set of special problems along the way. As opposed to most regular breakdowns, having these crucial components fail on you at the most inconvenient times can lead to even more problems down the road.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thankfully, avoiding the all-too-common mechanical problems and spoiling your driving experience simply entails being aware and watching out for all the signs before misfortune makes a visit.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you&rsquo;ve been meaning to stay aware at all times along with making sure that your truck runs smoothly, here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about bad fuel injectors, what causes them, and how you can avoid them entirely:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>The basics: </strong><strong><em>what do your fuel injectors do, and what causes them to go faulty?</em></strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Generally speaking, fuel injectors are entrusted with the responsibility of precisely delivering a controlled amount of fuel to your engine at the right times for efficient combustion&mdash; which is the foundation of smooth driving experiences. Through the use of electronically-controlled valves, the injectors supplement the engine&rsquo;s cylinders at spray rates and frequencies that span for fractions of a second.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In most cases, these parts can fail over time due to a lack of regular maintenance which leads to clogging and the development of faults. Over time, these underlying problems can exponentially grow in magnitude and cause a domino effect of issues that will end up tearing your engine up inside-out.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>What signs you need to watch out for</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Every diesel truck exhibits the same symptoms of faulty fuel injector systems that any driver needs to watch out for. Fortunately, these very signs are distinct and can be spotted easily with a minimal amount of awareness:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><em>Your check engine warning light is on</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the clearest signs that your fuel injectors need to be checked out right away is when your check engine warning light begins to pop up on your dashboard. For most cases, this light will only come on if an injector isn&rsquo;t working as well as it should&mdash; which causes a signal that&rsquo;s sent to the ECU and relayed to the dashboard.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><em>Your engine is stalling</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another clear sign that your fuel injector needs to be replaced is any present sign of engine stalling. When it comes to stalling engines, the experience of having random cuts is caused by an insufficient amount of fuel being supplied to the cylinders&mdash; which is then picked up by the ECU and acted on by intermittent on-and-off sensation in the engine itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><em>You&rsquo;re experiencing constant misfiring</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For most engines, misfiring and faulty fuel injectors go hand in hand as pops and bangs can only be caused by improper injection rates and broken systems. The symptoms of misfiring and vibrating engines are mainly rooted in clogs or blockages in the nozzles of the injectors, this throws off the fuel-to-air ratio off entirely&mdash; leading to imbalanced combustions and drops in acceleration!</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to any kind of diesel truck or engine, it&rsquo;s essential to brush up on vital knowledge about fuel injectors, along with what causes them to go faulty. By spotting the warning signs quickly, you&rsquo;ll be able to avoid costlier repairs down the line and keep your engine running in the best shape possible at all times!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Are you in need of </span><a href=""https://usdieselparts.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">fuel injectors</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> for your Cummins, Duramax, or Powerstroke engines?

"9920","Cold Air Intakes: What They Are & What Benefits They Give","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Have you ever considered installing a cold air intake for your vehicle? If not, you should do so! It provides a massive boost to your engine's performance, effectively giving more power to your car and improving your driving experience. Nevertheless, know that there are many improvements you can make to your car, and installing a cold air intake is just one of them.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with what a cold air intake is, below is a quick guide on what they are and what benefits they have to offer.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>What is a cold air intake?</strong></span>&nbsp;</h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Put simply, a cold air intake (also known as CAI) is an assembly part that allows fresh air from the outside to enter directly to the engine. This provides the driver with more oxygen to light up fuel, pumping the car with even more power.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This type of air intake is labeled as ""cold"" because the air filter is moved out from the engine to another spot, such as the fender area. This allows cold air to enter the engine, as opposed to warmer air with the intake near the engine. For the uninitiated, colder air typically means more oxygen. As a result, the engine can enjoy plenty of oxygen to keep burning fuel because the entire installation allows for uninterrupted airflow.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>What are the benefits of a cold air intake?</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Know that there are many benefits to installing a CAI into your vehicle. Here are a few that you should know:</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>1. It improves mileage</strong></span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The biggest benefit of installing a cold air intake in your car is that it helps improve the mileage by a significant margin. This is because&ndash;&ndash;thanks to the burst of oxygen&ndash;&ndash;less fuel is required to turn the pistons. Without a CAI installed, however, your engine becomes deprived of oxygen. While it will still run, it will suck up more fuel to compensate for the lack of oxygen to successfully light up the chamber to turn the pistons.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Once you have the CAI installed, your miles per gallon improve significantly. In addition to that, you save plenty of money that would have been spent on fuel, effectively allowing the CAI to pay itself off in the long run in terms of cost saved.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>2. It boosts acceleration</strong></span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you test two cars, one with CAI and the other without, you will feel the difference in terms of the acceleration. The car with the additional part will accelerate much quicker because it allows for a sudden burst of air to fill the engine when required.</span></p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>3. It enhances engine roar</strong></span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Do you love the sound of a roaring engine? If so, then you must consider installing a cold air intake. While a cold air intake is not designed to produce any sound, the rush of air entering the engine adds an enhanced roar that will satisfy any motorhead.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you are a car enthusiast who wants to add more performance to your engine, create a satisfying roaring engine sound, or save money on gas, installing a cold air intake can do you wonders in all three aspects. While it is an aftermarket upgrade and costs some money initially, it is one of the most cost-efficient upgrades you can ever do. Plus, CAIs are easy to maintain. With just some soap and water, you can keep your air filters clean and your engines running smoothly.</span></p>

"9921","Part Replacement: Choosing an Exhaust System for Your Truck","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Truck manufacturers often leave lots of room for additions and improvements to a truck&rsquo;s horsepower and torque. This is why the built-in exhaust system is easily replaceable for a better system in the market, which gives truck owners more variability in their vehicles.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Your truck&rsquo;s exhaust system is meant to divert reaction exhaust gases away from your vehicle&rsquo;s controlled combustion. Choosing to install an aftermarket performance exhaust will allow you to free up more of your engine&rsquo;s power while allowing for a quicker and more efficient way for exhaust gases to escape. As a result, this allows your truck to breathe better while maximizing your fuel usage at the same time.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Choosing the right exhaust system</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Your truck&rsquo;s factory exhaust system is meant to muffle as much sound as possible while still maintaining adequate power-robbing backpressure restricted by the exhaust gas flow from its pipelines. Aftermarket exhaust systems typically come in three different types that offer varying levels of less-restrictive performance depending on your preference. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In this article, we will share the three types of exhaust systems you can choose from:</span></p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>1. Cat-back systems</strong></span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cat-back exhaust systems revert your catalytic converter&rsquo;s components to your mufflers. These systems will include new tailpipes and mufflers, and can also have a mid-pipe, H-pipe, Y-pipe, or X-pipe, depending on your truck&rsquo;s models.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Furthermore, they have an advantage over other systems due to their low-cost power gains. With considerably better fuel economy compared to other system types, it&rsquo;s a formidable contender together due to the fact that these are emissions-legal systems because they incorporate your vehicle&rsquo;s stock catalytic converter.</span></p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>2. Header-back systems</strong></span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Choosing a Header-back exhaust system will force you to replace everything from your truck&rsquo;s header collector down to its tailpipes. By overhauling the entire exhaust system, you&rsquo;ll make your truck have a larger pipe diameter for greater exhaust flow.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One significant drawback of this exhaust system is that it&rsquo;ll be considerably expensive to install compared to a cat-back or axle-back exhaust system. You should only opt to retrofit your truck with a header-back exhaust system if you&rsquo;re looking to upgrade your entire system of all its components.</span></p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>3. Axle-back systems</strong></span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">An axle-back exhaust system is the most affordable system, mainly due to being the easiest system to install. It includes all the parts from your truck&rsquo;s rear axle to the exhaust tip. Though header-back and cat-backs offer more power gains, it doesn&rsquo;t cost nearly as little as what you&rsquo;d spend if you choose an axle-back exhaust system.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Once you&rsquo;ve decided on the type of exhaust system you want on your truck, you&rsquo;ll then have to consider if you&rsquo;ll go for a single or double exhaust system. Most people who prefer optimum performance choose the two-muffler look that&rsquo;s paired with high-flow capacity with two separate exhaust passages, one for each back of their truck&rsquo;s engine cylinders.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The key to choosing which system works best for your truck is finding the perfect balance of compatibility of the exhaust system to your model and your preference in handling your vehicle.</span></p>

"9922","A Beginner's Guide to Intercoolers","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In the world of trucks, there are many different sayings that drivers, mechanics, and manufacturers alike are bound to. Among all the different sayings and unbroken truths that continue to be applied, there&rsquo;s one that you should know about: <strong>A turbocharged engine is only as good as the intercooler that&rsquo;s paired with it.</strong></span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>An introduction to the supporting part</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Best regarded as one of the integral components to any diesel engine, the intercooler is responsible for ensuring that everything else in the assembly runs as smoothly as possible.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Commonly mounted behind the grille and positioned between the engine and turbochargers, this vital component acts as an air-to-heat exchanger that seeks to lower the overall temperature of the compressed intake air. Beyond temperature regulation, this part&mdash;which is also known as a charge air cooler&mdash;also helps compress the oxygen taken in by the turbocharger into a more consumable form for the engine to ingest for better <em>spooling</em>. </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Various forms worth taking note of</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Generally, intercoolers come in different iterations that each come with their own set of advantages, disadvantages, and appropriate applications. Let&rsquo;s go over each of them in further detail: </span></p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><br /> <strong><em>Standard intercoolers</em></strong></span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For any truck that comes with a stock diesel turbo engine, it&rsquo;s safe to assume that it also includes a stock intercooler that&rsquo;s built to support baseline numbers and ensure smooth performance with a standard turbo. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In the case of most trucks, these air-to-air models follow a plate-style core design and three-inch-thick bar. Most truck owners end up keeping their standard intercoolers even if they have a few additional mods because they&rsquo;re durable, simple to work with, and effective, all while saving a fortune.</span></p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong><em>Aftermarket intercoolers</em></strong></span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As the desire to make more out of a diesel engine begins to settle in, turbo diesel truck owners typically pay attention to the system they use to keep everything under control as the mods pile up. This is where an aftermarket intercooler comes in.<br /> <br /> Often seen as a non-negotiable for high-performance builds, aftermarket intercoolers are essentially standard options with greater capacities and capabilities to perform under pressure. What makes aftermarket intercoolers is that they feature larger cores, higher boost ratings, and upgraded construction to handle double, triple, or quadruple of a truck&rsquo;s stock horsepower output. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Such components are especially important to include in any performance build because they provide enhanced cooling performance that helps prevent various problems, such as damaged valves, melted pistons, and wiped-out turbos! </span></p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong><em>Water-to-air intercoolers</em></strong></span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In recent years, manufacturers have pulled out all the stops to provide consumers with more effective cooling systems that complement the higher power output brought about by performance parts. This is why parts like the water-to-air intercooler were produced. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">High-performance builds, in particular, are set to benefit the most from this special intercooler as it works better with greater amounts of fuel and boosts that are both on top as such configurations merit excessive amounts of heat. With the help of an efficient water circulation system, however, rising temperatures can be mitigated without suffering much boost drop or warp.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Without an adequate intercooler installed, your turbo diesel engine may not be able to perform or last as long as it should. This is why it is important to know exactly which option should be in your engine bay. By taking this guide into consideration, you&rsquo;ll be able to avoid any underlying problems and make sure that you&rsquo;re getting your money&rsquo;s worth during the build process!<br /> </span></p>

Fortunately, there are many ways to add more power to a diesel engine. Even better is that you don&rsquo;t need to spend a lot of money on expensive mods. Here are some ways to help you boost your diesel engine performance: </span></p>
<h2><span class=""s1""><strong>Boost Air Intake</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Boosting the airflow of your diesel engine is a sure way to increase its performance. This is because it will allow for more air to get to the engine, therefore, it will produce more power. Moreover, it can draw air outside the engine compartment, bringing in colder air. Cold air is denser and can hold more oxygen, which will also contribute to your engine power. </span></p>
<h2><span class=""s1""><strong>Use Diesel Fuel Additives</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Diesel fuel additives are fuel injection cleaners that can have your fuel injections running smoothly and more efficiently. Other diesel fuel additives that you can use are lubricants, corrosion inhibitors, freeze depressants, and many more. </span></p>
<h2><span class=""s1""><strong>Consider Turbochargers</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The turbo will push more air into the engine and pressurize the air intake. That said, you can expect to generate more power while you improve the efficiency of your engine. A turbocharger can increase airflow five to ten times, which will provide you with a significant boost in horsepower. </span></p>
<h2><span class=""s1""><strong>Upgrade Your Exhaust System</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Stock exhaust systems can only maximize noise reduction, while a performance exhaust will help increase the exhaust flow through the system. </span></p>
<h2><span class=""s1""><strong>Use Diesel Tuners</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Diesel tuners are also known as programmers that can help manage and boost your engine performance. One of the best things about this is that they are affordable and are very easy to install. Other than that, these can also boost your fuel economy. </span></p>
<h2><span class=""s1""><strong>Use Delete Kits</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Diesel performance delete kits are DieselParticular Filter (DPF), Diesel Engine Fluid (DEF), and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR). These are aftermarket kits that you can install in your engine. Each system has different functions but they can help remove systems from your engine to help improve its performance and fuel economy. </span></p>
<h2><span class=""s1""><strong>Upgrade Diesel Fuel Injectors</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Upgrade Diesel Fuel Injectors are performance fuel injectors that can give you more power and improve your fuel efficiency. You can find fuel injector mods that can increase engine horsepower by 50 to100 hp. </span></p>
<h2><span class=""s1""><strong>Modify Engine Control Module (ECM) </strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Modifying your ECM is one of the most affordable ways to upgrade your diesel engine. However, you need to have plenty of knowledge on this one before you take on an ECM upgrade project. If you want to go for this route, a professional mechanic can ensure that all that tuning, chipping, and remapping will be done right. </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The tips that we&rsquo;ve written above can help you boost your diesel truck engine. Remember that it&rsquo;s essential to get quality aftermarket parts when doing any of these upgrades and modifications.

"9916","How to Choose the Right Size of Turbocharger - Our Guide","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A turbocharged engine can produce more power, and for this reason alone, a lot of car enthusiasts switch to turbocharged engines. However, there are different sizes of turbochargers today because you can install them on any engine. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Whether you want to turbocharge your car or upgrade the existing one, keep in mind that the bigger isn&rsquo;t always better when it comes to turbocharging. You might also be tempted to get the smallest turbocharger that meets your horsepower goals, but that&rsquo;s not also the right solution.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So, the question is, how do you get the right size of turbocharger for your engine? Here are some tips:</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Budget</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It all begins with how much you&rsquo;re willing to spend on it. If you don&rsquo;t have enough funds, then there&rsquo;s no point getting one and putting yourself in debt, right? That&rsquo;s why before you buy a turbocharger for your engine, you need to assess your budget first. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Building a turbocharged engine doesn&rsquo;t just involve the cost of the turbocharger itself. Other things come with it, such as the things that you will need for the installation. </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Airflow</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Engines operate an air/fuel ratio while gasoline contains a specific amount of energy, which means that you can make a direct correlation between airflow in CFM and horsepower. That said, you will be able to come up with the required airflow in cubic feet of air per minute because, in turbochargers, it&rsquo;s not just about the boost. </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Non-Turbo Airflow</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Next, you need to calculate your engine&rsquo;s non-turbo airflow in CFM. There are different ways to do this: </span></p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Use an online CFM-to-horsepower calculator</span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Take the engine to a dyno room and check its non-turbo airflow. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Boost Pressure Ratio</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When you finally have your required airflow, it&rsquo;s time that you divide it by your engine&rsquo;s stock airflow to get the needed boost pressure ratio. </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Turbo Map</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A turbo map is a graph that contains airflow indexes to pressure ratio. It will give you a visual representation of turbo efficiency at a given pressure ratio and CFM. You can find this on a manufacturer&rsquo;s selection of turbo maps. </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Target Airflow/Pressure Point</strong></span></h2>

"9917","3 Parts of Your Diesel Engine That You Should Know About","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In the simplest explanation possible, the engine that your diesel truck runs on is its very own heart &mdash; the life force that helps keep everything running smoothly.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Without the engine, your vehicle obviously cannot be operated. Beyond that, however, what makes this particular part so unique is that it&rsquo;s necessarily a sum of different components that work together. As opposed to the consensus that this mechanical heart should be seen as a whole instead of the sum of its parts, the truth is that each component should be treated with equal importance.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>The three components of your diesel engine that you should know about</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Aside from knowing your truck on a more personal level, however, one of the most important reasons you should know about the pieces that comprise it is that doing so keeps your engine running for as long as possible. Amongst all the different parts that you&rsquo;ll need to deal with when looking at your diesel engine, there are three main parts that you should be well aware of, such as the following:</span></p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong><em>Diesel Injection Pumps</em></strong></span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Similar to the right atrium of a human heart that&rsquo;s responsible for pumping blood, the diesel injection pump is responsible for ensuring that a controlled amount of fuel is injected into an engine&rsquo;s cylinders.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Without a dependable and durable set of injection pumps, your truck won&rsquo;t start and run as well because fuel won&rsquo;t be supplied to the engine in the first place. By using toothed belts, chains, or gears, this very component rotates at half crankshaft speed to ensure that the cylinders are fed a steady amount of fuel to run as smoothly as possible while maintaining peak power output!</span></p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong><em>Cylinders</em></strong></span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Speaking of the diesel injection pump system, another essential component that you should be familiar with when glossing over the entire construction of your diesel engine is its cylinders. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The cylinders are primarily functioning as the muscle of the engine, responsible for making sure that the fuel keeps all the wheels turning as they&rsquo;re supposed to. Often, the most significant and costly problems and opportunities for performance enhancement come from these components because they play a pivotal role in the entire assembly&rsquo;s functionality. This essentially means that proper maintenance is vital!</span></p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong><em>Fuel injectors</em></strong></span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Similar to the fuel injection pumps that your diesel engine has, fuel injectors also play equally-important roles in keeping your engine running the way it should.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The primary function of this all-essential component is to spray a precise amount of fuel into an engine so that it can maintain an optimal level of combustion when the gas is mixed with air. Aside from keeping the engine&rsquo;s air-fuel ratio, this part is also responsible for following the right spray pattern, angle, and pressure to ensure that no premature wear and tear or breakdowns happen!</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Despite its seeming simplicity, getting familiar with the essential parts that comprise your diesel truck&rsquo;s engine can significantly help in ensuring that it operates as best as possible. By being well-aware of the components mentioned above and taking the time to maintain them and watch out for their associated warning signs, you&rsquo;ll be able to pick up a few good habits that any truck owner should have!</span></p>

"9918","Our Guide to Choosing the Right Axle Ratio for Your Pickup Truck","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Shopping for a pickup truck can be challenging as it involves looking deeper into its parts to ensure your choice will meet your needs and lifestyle. From analyzing the motor, transmission, torque, driveline choices, and more, there&rsquo;s plenty of specifications to think about. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Part of the details you can&rsquo;t ignore includes the axle ratio options of a vehicle, which can make or mar your pickup truck&rsquo;s torque and towing capacity. More than that, it also plays a pivotal role in indicating the vehicle&rsquo;s fuel economy. </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>What is Axle Ratio and Why Does it Matter? </strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Axle ratio defines the number of rations of a vehicle. This includes the driveshaft, which is responsible for producing one rotation of the axle. The axle ratio plays a critical role since modern cars are made with intricate gears to promote different rates. Hence, the rear axle allows the wheels to rotate at different speeds to maintain excellent traction. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The axle ratio of a pickup truck is between three to four, which means the driveshaft will need to turn between three to four times to turn to achieve one rotation of the axle&mdash;with that in mind, knowing the axle ratio matters since it different numbers can have various impacts on the vehicle. </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>What are the Different Trade-Offs of Varying Axle Ratios For Your Truck? </strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A higher ratio, like a 3.9, for instance, gives drivers the ability to carry and pull heavier loads. However, the trade-off between a high axle ratio means you&rsquo;re sacrificing fuel economy and speed. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">On the other hand, a lower axle ratio promotes a higher fuel economy with lower torque and towing power. With that in mind, choosing the right axle ratio largely depends on your needs and how you plan to operate the truck. </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Different Types of Axle Ratios For Trucks - What is a Standard Axle Ratio?</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A standard axle ratio is generally the best, universal choice for most truck drivers, especially for those taking highway speeds as part of their route. Turning the axle faster means the driver can benefit from burning fuel, which saves on fuel since the engine doesn&rsquo;t have to work double to turn the wheels. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is an excellent choice for truck drivers who need to prioritize road speed or fuel economy. Meanwhile, front or rear-wheel-drive trucks also have varying ratios depending on the rear and front axle, but all-wheel drive trucks work better with similar front and rear axle ratios. </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>The Bottom Line: Choosing the Right Axle Ratio For Your Truck that Caters to Your Daily Needs</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Choosing the right axle ratio for your truck depends on how much you need to tow and how fast you need to drive. You can quickly determine the average by assessing the weight of your daily cargo and finding how much money you can save when you achieve fewer miles per gallon.</span></p>

<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Look for a water-demulsifying fuel additive (instead of those that burn the water) as it keeps the injectors flowing at full capacity.</span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Use a diesel fuel additive for fuel gelling, especially during colder months.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>3. Changing diesel oil and filter</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The lifespan of diesel engine oil depends a lot on the frequency of driving and its conditions. Know, however, that changing the oil should be a part of your regular upkeep. Here&rsquo;s what you should do:</span></p>

"9912","3 Facts About Diesel Fuel Additives Every Driver Should Know","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For the past few years, the term &ldquo;<em>diesel fuel additives</em>&rdquo; has been mentioned at an increasing rate as truck owners continue to find ways to improve their driving experience.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">To many, this &ldquo;magic liquid&rdquo; has become an essential part of their toolbox because of how well it improves the fuel efficiency of a vehicle and the longevity of the engine. Beyond better mileages and longevity, however, what most car and diesel truck heads don&rsquo;t know about this formulated automotive liquid is that there&rsquo;s much more to it than one may expect!</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>A few facts about fuel additives</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you&rsquo;ve gotten your hands on a bottle of diesel fuel additive but want to learn more about it, here are a few interesting facts about the compound: </span></p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>1. <em>Additives play a much bigger role than you might expect</em></strong></span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One of the most important aspects that any diesel truck owner should know is that the very fuel that their vehicle runs on needs additives more than any other type of fuel out there. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When compared to gasoline, diesel essentially has a greater number of properties that need to be protected by additives. This is why more and more types of automotive supplements are made every year. The main reason additives are so important, in particular, is that they help compensate for the lack of refinery of the fuel itself and ensure that its performance in cold weather, lubricity, and certain rating are all protected!</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">With a proper serving every time you refill your tank, you&rsquo;ll be able to ensure that the diesel you use gets to perform the way it&rsquo;s supposed to regarding combustion, consumption, and emission. </span></p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>2.<em> Diesel engines today are much cleaner</em></strong></span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Thanks to the continuous development of various manufacturers, such as Cummins, Ford, and General Motors, diesel engines have now come far from their pre-conceived image as black smoke-pumping machines. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">With government regulations in full effect and emissions control regulations continuously enforced in development and production stages, today&rsquo;s models are much cleaner. An important factor to note, however, is that diesel engines can only reach the maximum potential of cleaner emissions if they&rsquo;re supplemented with fuel that&rsquo;s been mixed with additives as these compounds help keep everything running smoothly! </span></p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><br /> <strong>3.</strong> <strong><em>A longer lifespan is possible with additives</em></strong></span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In most cases, diesel truck owners have begun storing diesel for future use in cases of emergencies. While this may be a great way to save on costs, however, the fuel itself isn&rsquo;t necessarily the longest-lasting component out there. With a proper serving of diesel fuel additive, however, you&rsquo;ll be able to keep the content of your barrels in proper shape for longer because it helps protect the very compounds that comprise it. </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Conclusions</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Thanks to the use of fuel additives, diesel engines today can enjoy a wide range of benefits that contribute to their overall efficiency and long-term health. As a matter of fact, the humble compound itself bears far more benefits than one may expect, such as the ones mentioned above!<br /> <br /> We&rsquo;re a distinguished <a href=""https://usdieselparts.com/""><span class=""s2"">supplier of automotive parts in the US</span></a> for Chevy Duramax, Dodge Cummins, and Ford Powerstroke trucks.

"9913","The Differences Between Lifting & Leveling - Our Guide","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As a truck owner, you want to know the best upgrades and the best methods to achieve optimal performance. Some of the most common upgrades you can get are either lifting and leveling upgrades. You may have heard of them before, but perhaps you&rsquo;re not entirely sure about how these upgrades work. To help you better understand, here are the differences between lifting and leveling and which upgrade to get:</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Lifting and Leveling</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">First and foremost, both of these methods are aimed towards raising the body of the truck. Doing so will enable you to fit larger tires and improve ground clearance. Both lifting and leveling kits are designed to reposition the body away from the axles.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Main Differences</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">While both kit methods are done to lift the truck, the exact measurements do vary. With a leveling kit, the body is lifted about two inches maximum at the front side. A leveling kit will make the front of the truck raised, and if you prefer a stock-style stance, you can pair it with a spacer block to raise the rear of the truck.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">On the other hand, lifting kits raise the truck even higher than a leveling kit can do. Lifting the truck higher is made possible by modifying the suspension parts. For this, you can choose anywhere from two inches to ten inches in kit sizes. You can also go for custom lift kits if you prefer a much larger size.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In terms of ease, leveling kits are simple to install and less process is required to install them. That said, while lifting kits are more complex, they provide a more comprehensive array of features that leveling kits don&rsquo;t have, including springs, shocks, control arms, and more.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Advantages of Leveling and Lifting</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Leveling allows for larger tires that can be placed on all four corners, hence the term &ldquo;leveling.&rdquo; Most pickup trucks can hit the fender or bumper, especially during sharper turns. In this scenario, leveling is a good entry-level solution. Leveling kits are great at addressing the sagging issue of the suspension when something is added to the front of the truck. They keep the front of the truck leveled with the rear.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Lifting is primarily applied to allow the fitting of large tires. If you prefer to run with large wheels, you can use a lifting kit to help the vehicle run smoothly. Lifting kits are also great for raising all modifications that are generally in contact with the road when things start getting intense, especially for off-road sessions. In general, lifting kits are spectacular for giving large trucks better ground clearance.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Disadvantages of Leveling and Lifting</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It should be noted that there are cons to any modification, which means you&rsquo;re sacrificing something to achieve another feature. With leveling kits, you&rsquo;re giving up style. Leveling kits aren&rsquo;t as sleek and modern looking as lifting kits.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">On the flip side, lift kits, while they look clean and modern, they don&rsquo;t provide the same support that leveling kits do. Also, they can be extremely complicated to install.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Put simply, leveling kits are affordable and are more stable. They&rsquo;re also very easy to install, which calls for fewer labor charges. Lifting kits are amazing in terms of design and additional functionality. While they may not be as stable as leveling kits, they provide access to other kits that compensate for that.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Keeping your turbocharged diesel engine doesn&rsquo;t take genius-level intellect or top-notch, high-cost maintenance procedures. In this article, we will share with you a guide on how you can effectively maintain a turbocharged diesel engine.</span></p>
<h3><strong><em>Dealing with the turbocharger&nbsp;</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the most important parts of the maintenance process is making sure that you follow the necessary measures to prevent your engine from failing prematurely while keeping its performance at an all-time high. Here&rsquo;s a tried-and-tested tip that is definitely essential if you want to keep your diesel turbocharger running smoothly: </span><strong>Let your truck warm up on idle.</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although this may sound simple, a surefire way to prevent any form of premature breakage is to let your vehicle start-up and remain idle for several minutes. The reason this is so important lies in the fact that warming up an engine properly allows it to get its own turbocharger to an optimal operating temperature without the risk of cracking.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Additionally, a proper warm-up allows sufficient oil to reach all the various parts in your system so that everything is lubed up enough for proper operation, and this includes your turbocharger.</span></p>
<h3><strong><em>Fuel additives</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to proper maintenance, fuel additives&mdash;alongside biodiesel and ULSD&mdash;will always be your best friend. Additives options that are complete and compatible with the type of fuel that you use are absolutely essential because they help ensure that the contents of your tank perform their task in the most optimal way possible. From fuel gelling to octane maintenance, these nifty bottles of automotive supplements play a key role in keeping your turbocharged diesel engine running as it should for as long as possible.</span></p>
<h3><strong><em>Oil and filters</em></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another important detail to consider when maintaining your turbocharged diesel engine is that it heavily relies on regular oil and filter changes to run smoothly. Given that engines are essentially high-heat running motors, it&rsquo;s important to ensure that everything is kept as clean and pure as possible so that nothing goes where it isn&rsquo;t supposed to go. With regular oil changes and filter replacements, you can assure yourself of a safe and smooth drive every single time!</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

"9915","Engine Maintenance Checklist for Truck Owners - What to Know","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Do you have a truck that you use on a regular basis? If that&rsquo;s the case, then it&rsquo;s important for you to know how to take care of it properly. Routine engine maintenance will help keep your truck in top working condition, saving you repair costs and unnecessary hassle. It will also ensure that the vehicle remains safe to drive, which is arguably one of the biggest priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With that being said, how exactly should you maintain your truck&rsquo;s engine? That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll discuss in this article. Below, we&rsquo;ll list down several tips for truck maintenance that you should follow.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Replace the engine oil and filter when needed</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let&rsquo;s start with the engine, where most common truck problems arise. You&rsquo;ll want to pay attention to two things here. The first is the quality of the engine oil, and the second is that of the engine air filter.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The engine oil is what keeps your engine running smoothly. It acts as a lubricant that reduces the amount of friction between the individual components. Over time, this oil gets dirty. It gets exposed to dirt that prevents it from performing optimally. If the problem gets serious enough, it could lead to damaged engine components, frequent overheating, and complete engine failure.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The air filter is similarly important. It acts as the engine&rsquo;s first line of defense against dust, dirt, and other airborne contaminants. When this gets dirty, more these pollutants can make their way into the engine and cause it to malfunction. It also means that less clean air is able to enter the machine, robbing it of power.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A general rule of thumb for replacing these components is to replace the oil every 5,000 miles, and every 15,000 miles for the air filter.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Don&rsquo;t forget the other car fluids</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let&rsquo;s move on to the other important fluids in your truck. These include the brake fluid, the power steering fluid, and the engine coolant.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The brake fluid is what allows your brakes to function. Without it, you&rsquo;d have no way of safely driving your vehicle. The biggest factor that contributes to its deterioration is moisture, which means you&rsquo;ll have to replace it more frequently if you drive in wet conditions. Experts recommend changing your brake fluid every two to four years, depending on your usual driving conditions, the truck&rsquo;s age, and several other factors.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The power steering fluid is what lets you maneuver your truck. It is directly connected to the power steering pump and rack, which means that if the fluid goes bad, the other expensive components can get damaged as well. This fluid usually gets dirty simply due to wear and tear. You will have to replace it every 50,000 miles. However, this figure will also depend on different factors.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Finally, the engine coolant does two things for your truck: one, it helps regulate the temperature of the engine, and two, it prevents corrosion. This, too, will break down over time, which could mean that your engine will start to rust and overheat at the same time. You will want to replace this every 30,000 miles.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Apart from these tips, you also want to check your engine regularly for any signs of damage. Corrosion is not normal in engines, and neither is the presence of strange noises when the engine is running. Make sure you pay attention to these signs so that you can fix the problem or have an expert do it for you.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Either way, it&rsquo;s in your best interest that you make sure that your engine is running properly, so take regular maintenance seriously.</span></p>

"9908","Our Beginner's Guide to Lift Kit Modifications","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Today, it&rsquo;s quite rare to see a diesel truck in its stock form six months or so out of the dealership. With all the modification options available on the market, it&rsquo;s no secret that many owners are now making their truck truly their own. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Regardless of whether it&rsquo;s about a forged wheel replacement, snorkeler kit, or turbocharger upgrade, there will always be opportunities to customize and upgrade a truck. Out of all the different upgrade options available for all sorts of owners to enjoy, however, there&rsquo;s one particular add-on that&rsquo;s become much more popular: <strong>lift kits.</strong></span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>The popularity of the vertical upgrade</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Coming a long way from its dirt track and monster truck origins, these upgrades can be seen in hundreds of thousands of different set-ups all over America.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The ideal truck in most people&rsquo;s eyes is one that&rsquo;s quite a bit above the ground, making it perfect for crossing through rivers, scaling rocks, and driving around in the dirt. With the help of a lift kit, you can bring your trucking dreams to life and give your rig the freedom it needs to stay true to its rugged and rough-and-tumble nature. </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>What the kit is comprised of</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Generally, the intricacies of any truck&rsquo;s suspension and chassis have led to the rise of model-and-manufacturer-specific kits that have the necessary components to best suit its needs. <br /> <br /> In most cases, a standard lift kit includes strut spacers, lift blocks, and coil springs that are manufactured to best meet the needs of a particular make and model with the highest quality possible. For an added price, you can also get an extra set of trailing and control arms to make sure that your kit is properly set in place and is durable enough to last for many years. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It is worth noting that the components themselves entail having a few alterations to the steering geometry, drive shaft length, and brake lines of a truck to make sure that everything&rsquo;s functional. </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Is it a good idea to install your own lift kit?</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong><br /></strong>Given the complexities of a truck&rsquo;s system and all the technical know-how that come with installing a lift kit, there&rsquo;s a small margin for error and many ways that you can mess up your vehicle. When you make the unwise decision to fit the kit in by yourself, here are a few risks that are bound to pop up sooner or later: </span></p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Unsafe and unbalanced handling on the road</span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Premature wear-and-tear on your suspension system and driveline&mdash; leading to even more costly replacement costs</span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Poor driving performance</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Unlike standard cosmetic changes, lift kits are functional and aesthetic in nature, meaning that only an expert with a proper amount of engineering knowledge is capable of safely installing it. </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Should you get a body or suspension lift?</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When it comes to making a choice between both options, it&rsquo;s important to note that the answer to the dilemma entirely depends on what you need.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For instance, body lift kits are purely for cosmetic purposes, such as adding bigger tires and getting a taller vertical look because it uses spacers to increase the height of the cabin. When put through rough conditions, such as rock crawling and cross-terrain runs, however, it&rsquo;s safe to say that they may end up failing on you.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Suspension lifts, on the other hand, are geared towards hardcore truckers who need a dependable system that can hold up rugged off-road performance while providing a good amount of clearance. Performance suspension lifts, for instance, allow any driver to add wider tires and functional coil overs to provide a better experience and maintain balance at all times.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you&rsquo;re looking to add a significant cosmetic upgrade to your truck and improve its performance in handling various terrain and road conditions, then a lift kit will be best for your needs.<br /> <br /> We&rsquo;re a <a href=""https://usdieselparts.com/""><span class=""s2"">diesel truck parts specialist</span></a> that supplies parts for Dodge, Ford, and Chevy truck models in Montana and all of America.

"9909","Suspension Lift Kit: What It Does & Why You Need It","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">There are many vehicles that offer various forms of flexibility for a wide range of uses. For instance, Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) can be best modified with a handful of accessories to be used for various purposes. This is where a suspension lift kit comes into the picture. It is a form of modification done to raise the vehicle&rsquo;s height and attain extra inches of ground clearance.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you are wondering why you will need such a modification, we&rsquo;ll share with you what a typical lift kit entails and the benefit of having it, in the sections below.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>What a typical lift kit includes</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Simply put, a lift kit is a kit consisting of a few parts required to lift a particular vehicle model along with instructions on how to perform it. If you&rsquo;re wondering what is included in a lift kit, take note of the following:</span></p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Smaller lift kit:</strong> This kit is usually designed to attain a three-inch lift by using shock mount spacers that are bolted in place to augment the lift height. </span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Larger, more complete kit: </strong>This kit is meant to achieve a three-inch lift and above by using control arms, shock absorbers, and the relocation brackets to install the kit.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Other modifications to consider </strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">There are a few other modifications to consider before thinking about getting a lift kit. Keep in mind that the ride height achieved through the use of a lift kit may impact other areas of the vehicle. Below are other modifications to factor in whenever you consider adding a lift kit:</span></p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Trailer hitch with hitch step:</strong> Installing a trailer hitch with an attachable hitch step will help you get access to the bed of your SUV with ease.</span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Step bumper: </strong>As the trailer hitch may be undesirable to the off-road community, you may have rear bumpers configured with hitch steps to offer a benefit on multiple fronts.</span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Side steps:</strong> Side steps or running boards can be configured to help you have access to the extended cabin.</span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Differential gears: </strong>Lower gears can help restore the loss of power brought by adding bigger tires and a lift, and improve the vehicle&rsquo;s acceleration.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Why you need a lift kit</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Now, let&rsquo;s take a look at why a lift is important and why it needs to lift a vehicle in the first place. Below are three main reasons to utilize a lift kit for your vehicle:</span></p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Suspension capabilities:</strong> A lift kit can increase the capabilities of the suspension, which can significantly increase ride quality, suspension travel, and durability.</span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Ground clearance</strong>: A lift kit can be added with bigger tires that can truly augment the ground clearance. This essentially increases the distance of the vehicle&rsquo;s body from the terrain below.</span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Wheel fitment:</strong> A lift kit can help increase the size of the tire that can be fitted underneath.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Overall, a lift kit is a great modification that helps to increase the vehicle&rsquo;s height and ground clearance. If you did not know much about lift kits before, we hope that this blog has clarified as to why you have to invest in it for the good of your vehicle and for other uses.</span></p>

"9910","3 Tips on How to Keep Your Old Diesel Truck Roadworthy - Our Guide","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Old diesel trucks never cease to become even more amazing to experience and enjoy as they grow older over the years. From &lsquo;94 7.0-liter Ford Powerstrokes to &lsquo;88 Dodge 12 Valves, the truck models of the past bear a ruggedness to them that contributes to their overall character unlike any other. This is what makes them much more collectible these days. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you own an old diesel truck, then you&rsquo;re probably familiar with the appeal of the characteristic styling and driving experience that it bears. Now, as great as it may be to have a piece of automotive history in your garage, however, there&rsquo;s one question that may cross your mind: </span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><strong>&ldquo;Am I doing everything that&rsquo;s necessary to keep it on the road?&rdquo;</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Fortunately, keeping an old diesel truck as roadworthy as possible doesn&rsquo;t have to be a painstaking process that involves throwing money out of the window. In fact, it&rsquo;s quite the opposite. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you want to hit the road with your classic diesel truck and make sure that it serves you well on any drive in the long run, here are three tips that can help it stay in tip-top shape: </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>1.<em> Invest in quality oil and have it changed on a regular basis</em></strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Out of all the different aspects that make classic diesel trucks so unique, the most noteworthy one that any driver should know is that some good oil and a routine change go a long way in keeping its engine primed for performance. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As opposed to regular car engines today that come with many parts that make the entire process of maintaining performance much more complicated, old Cummins, Duramax, and Powerstroke engines are actually straightforward. By simply following your manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendations, adding in the specified type of oil, and changing it regularly, you can easily keep your old diesel truck running smoothly for many years. </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>2.<em> Keep an eye out for your engine wear items</em></strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When it comes to keeping an old workhorse driving the same way it came out of the factory, it&rsquo;s important to note that engine wear items play a significant role in how long everything can run smoothly and safely.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Various parts, such as pulley bearings, tensioners, serpentine belts, and water pumps, have specific functions that contribute to the overall performance of a truck. Although these parts may seem quite minor at first, they can make the difference between your truck&rsquo;s ability in making it to 150,000 miles on an interval or barely making it to 50,000. This is why you should make sure that you get your wear-prone parts checked regularly!</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>3. <em>Service your truck regularly</em></strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If there&rsquo;s any key to maintaining the longevity of your old diesel truck that would guarantee longevity the most, it would definitely be having it serviced regularly. With a regular maintenance service, you&rsquo;ll be able to keep your truck in pristine condition by carrying out regular processes, such as spark plug checks, wheel alignment, and soot deposit removals. All these checks will work best for the longevity of your vehicle as well! </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When it comes to keeping an old diesel truck running smoothly for many years of happy use, it&rsquo;s important to note that what you do to keep it in great shape will make a significant difference in its lifespan!</span></p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In this article, we will share with you five maintenance tips for your diesel truck to ensure its optimal performance and longevity in the long run:</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>1. Schedule regular cleaning</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As with any type of vehicle, regular cleaning of your diesel truck is a must. It&rsquo;s best to set a regular schedule for the cleaning of your truck. The goal is to get rid of gunk, as your truck&rsquo;s parts can get built up with dirt and grime over long periods. The same is true for your fuel that ought to be strictly clean because all these factors can drive high performance and help foster a healthy fuel economy.</span></p>

<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>3. Don&rsquo;t forget to change the filters</strong></span></h2>

For instance, in 2016, there eight million diesel passenger vehicles could be found on the road in the United States, and 72% of trucks with a vehicle weight of at least 10,001 pounds sold in the United States in 2013 had diesel engines. They are even used widely in a broad range of settings, from ambulances to airport shuttle buses to delivery vans of all stripes. Diesel vehicles offer many benefits; let's take a spin around some helpful information on buying diesel.</p><br /><p><br /><ol><br /><li>The quiet is remarkable. Historically, diesel engines were thought to be a bit on the noisy side. But modern diesel trucks have very quiet engines. Many ears cannot tell the difference between a diesel engine and a gas engine.</p><br /><p><br /><li>Diesel vehicles boast a lower cost of ownership over time. By using much less fuel than gas vehicles, diesel engines allow you to realize substantial returns on your investment over your years of ownership. Work Truck Magazine recently cited the U.S. Department of Energy's finding that diesel engines offer 30% to 35% better fuel economy than comparable gasoline engines.</p><br /><p><br /><li>Diesel trucks require regular maintenance, as does any vehicle, but they require less than many gasoline-powered vehicles. Diesel engines have fewer components than spark engines, so you won't have to worry about spark plugs or distributors. Fewer tune-ups mean lower maintenance costs. For instance, the average diesel fuel pump is designed to last for approximately 50,000 miles and fuel pumps can have an even longer life than that with proper care and maintenance. When the time comes, <a href=""https://usdieselparts.com/c-778581-dodge-1994-1998-5-9l-dodge-12-valve.html"">fuel pumps</a> are relatively easy and inexpensive to replace.</p><br /><p><br /><li>Value retention. Simply put, when you've got two comparably equipped, used and maintained trucks, with one powered by gas and the other powered by diesel, the diesel truck will almost always go for a higher resale amount.</p> <br /><p><br /><li>Towing capacity. Smaller diesel engines start with a towing capacity of around ten thousand pounds and the numbers grow from there. If you've got heavy work or camping equipment to tow on a regular basis, diesel may be the way to go for you.</p><br /><p></ol><br />Check out your diesel vehicle and parts provider to have a look around and find your best fit!</p>","0","","Diesel vehicles offer many benefits; let's take a spin around some helpful information on buying diesel.","","5 Great Reasons to Buy Diesel Vehicles and Parts","","News",""
