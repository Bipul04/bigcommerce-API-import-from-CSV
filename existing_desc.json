Our 6.5L PMD Cooler Kit conveniently mounts your new pump mounted driver (PMD) on the intake manifold. This is a very nice, tidy installation and provides much cooler and more consistent temperatures that will keep the PMD from failing. Also, when using our relocation kit, there is no need to remove the intake manifold from the engine because the old PMD can simply stay mounted to the injection pump."

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

The movement of the fuel inside the tank, and the process of fuel transfer under these conditions creates as much as 10% air/vapor within the fuel. Symptoms of air/vapor can be low horsepower, poor fuel mileage, excessive smoke, injector failure, hard starting, surging and rough running.

Ford entered into the light truck diesel market in the early 80's with their Navistar 6.9L and 7.3L IDI naturally aspirated V8 engines which were a huge success for Ford. In 1994 they released the 210 hp Navistar 7.3L Power Stroke engine. Navistar utilized an advanced Hydraulically Activated, Electronically Controlled Unit Injector, or \"HEUI\" for short. Although this unique fuel system seemed years ahead of its time, it had already been proven in the heavy truck market by the time Ford got their hands on it. In 1999, the 7.3L received an intercooler and changes were made to the turbo and injectors. In 2001, we saw power increase to 250-275 hp. The first major modifications to the Ford Power Stroke were made in 2003 with the arrival of the 325 hp 6.0L Power Stroke, and the 7.3L was officially discontinued in 2004. A Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT), Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) and Overhead Valves (OHV) were utilized on the new 6.0L to keep up with emissions demands. 2008 saw the arrival of the 350 hp 6.4L Twin-Turbo Common Rail engine. Advanced emissions make it one of the cleanest running diesel engines ever produced, but owners still report poor fuel mileage. We offer Power Stroke diesel parts that can improve your vehicleâ€™s performance.

The cooler, denser air helps increase horsepower and reduce EGTs. The turbine housing was changed to a .84 A/R and a wastegate was also added. The single shot HEUI injectors were changed to split shot design, and the high-pressure oil pump was advanced to 17Â° to help increase the necessary fuel pressure. The 1998 7.3L PS was rated at 225 hp, and the 1999 - 2000 models were rated at 235 hp. 2001 - 2003 saw another boost to about 250-275 hp from the factory.

Founded in England in 1983, Superchips was one of the first companies to specialize in tuning vehicles with computer controlled fuel-injection systems. While Superchips originally focused on serving the British racing community with high-end solutions, the Company eventually began to provide power to performance enthusiasts throughout the world. Now, Superchips sells tens of thousands of hand-held programmers per year from its headquarters in Ogden, Utah.  In 2005, Superchips was acquired by MSD Performance. In 2011 Superchips became part of Powerteq LLC, which today owns and manages the Edge Products and Diablosport brands â€“ two of the most popular performance tuning brands in North America.  In 2015, Powerteq LLC, along with the other MSD Performance Group brands, was acquired by the Holley Performance Group.  The deep line of Holley brands marries tremendous technology with cutting-edge resources and industry roots. The combination of talented personnel at Powerteq and the resources of Holley Performance Group ensure that exciting aftermarket products will launch from Superchips for many years to come.</p>"

It can be an easy decision at first to change out your turbocharger for a performance turbo.  This is where most encounter their first wall in doing so.  The diesel performance world has so many options that it quickly becomes very difficult on choosing what turbo is right for you.  You can search the web, ask your buddies, check out forums and by the end of the day, you most likely still will be confused and settle back on buying a stock turbocharger.  Don't do it!  We're not being cliche' when we say \"Let the pro's help\" because we really can help make the best decision for your vehicles turbocharger needs.  At the same time we're also not trying to sell you the biggest and most bad-ass turbo you can afford when a more refined solution will perform better.  Let us explain below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\r\n    font-weight: 900;\r\n    color: #005eaf;\r\n    text-transform: uppercase;\r\n    line-height: normal;\r\n    text-shadow: 0px 4px 4px #c7c3c3;\"><b>Most people are looking for an upgraded turbocharger for two basic reasons:</b><br />They want better pulling power -and/or- Their stock turbo has failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people want to go as big as they can, and we can help if that's what you're looking for, but for the most part we've found the majority may only need a simple stage 1 upgrade to give them that extra pulling power and performance they're looking for.  You can quickly find yourself having to build around a large turbocharger ~ often to get the same performance you could have gotten from a smaller turbo without the problems or extra costs associated with doing so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We've been installing upgraded turbos for well over two decades and feel we have enough experience to put our customers into a turbocharger that fits their needs. To do this, and help clear up the confusion, we put together a selection of  turbochargers below that are simple, straight forward to install, that may only require a small amount of extra fueling to perform.  These turbos are excellent in quality, have been proven to perform, and are designed to run with your emissions intact. Anytime you upgrade to a larger turbo you will have more turbo lag. Turbo lag is the response time it takes for the turbo to spool up. The more turbo lag you have, the more smoke and less drive-ability you will have. We recommend a tuner to help that turbo spool up quicker so you will have less smoke, lower EGTâ€™s, and make the drive more enjoyable.  If you donâ€™t have a tuner already and need help on choosing the best one that fits your needs or if you want more options on the turboâ€™s please feel free to call us.</p>",
