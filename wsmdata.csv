<p align=""left"">Our factory trained and certified technicians have been rebuilding DB2 injection pumps since they were introduced by Stanadyne, so we know them inside and out. Each pump is completely disassembled, thoroughly inspected and all worn parts replaced with genuine OEM Stanadyne components. The pump is then cleaned, reassembled and precisely calibrated to factory specifications. One weak point on Stanadyne DB2 pumps that is often ignored by most rebuilders is the advance bore. The aluminum housing tends to wear out quickly where the steel advance piston is located, causing poor pump timing, poor fuel mileage, excess smoke and low power. We address this problem by utilizing a steel sleeve in the advance bore. This gives us a more precise pump calibration and a superior injection pump that will last considerably longer.</p>
<p align=""left"">All DB2 injection pumps include a 1-year warranty.</p>

"Chevy / GMC","1993 - 2000 GM 6.5L Turbo Diesel (Electronic)","<p align=""left"">US Diesel Parts carries a great selection of 6.5L diesel turbo performance parts and stock parts for your 1993-2000 GM truck. The Stanadyne DS4 electronic diesel fuel injection pump has marked its place in diesel history. We rebuilt hundreds of them under the GM warranty service period before they finally got all the bugs worked out. Some of them passed through our doors 2-3 times or more before the customer could actually get their truck out of the driveway. GM and Stanadyne took a huge gamble when they neglected to do some proper testing on their new system, but the good news is that the DS4 injection pump is actually a pretty solid and reliable unit now. The PMD is still an issue, but we've even got the answers to all of your PMD problems that will eliminate your hot hard starting and intermittent stalling issues. We also have some great performance upgrades for the electronics, exhaust system, intake and turbocharger that will help you get some better fuel economy and some really decent horsepower gains. If you don't see the 6.5L diesel turbo performance upgrades that you're looking for here, then please call us.</p>","

<p align=""left"">Incorporating BD's exclusive Variable Orifice Technology, the
BD brake provides up to 150 retarding horsepower throughout the engine's RPM
range - not just at high RPM like other brands. The rugged, cast-iron housing
incorporates BD's exclusive alumibronze bushing and piston ring-sealed, stainless

<br>
If your 6.5L diesel (with the DS4 electronic injection pump) is showing symptoms of stalling, hard starting, and hesitation, then you don't necessarily need to replace the injection pump as most shops and dealerships will try to tell you. The PMD (Pump Mounted Driver) is prone to failure from constant heating and cooling when mounted inside the engine compartment and needs to be moved out in order to assure maximum performance and long service life. Our 6.5L PMD Cooler Kit conveniently mounts your new pump mounted driver (PMD) on the intake manifold. This is a very nice, tidy installation and provides much cooler and more consistent temperatures that will keep the PMD from failing. Also, when using our relocation kit, there is no need to remove the intake manifold from the engine because the old PMD can simply stay mounted to the injection pump.","","778328","https://usdieselparts.com/images/F95105297","","","","450","Chevy / GMC>1993 - 2000 GM 6.5L Turbo Diesel (Electronic)>PMD's, Coolers, DS4 Pump Parts - GM 6.5L TD","2013-05-31 17:36:52",""

<p>GM joined forces with Isuzu in 2001 to release the first 6.6L Duramax LB7
engine featuring the latest in Bosch Common Rail Injector technology. They experienced
some injector issues early on, but quickly addressed the problems.
The mighty 6.6L Duramax pumped out a respectable 300HP right off the showroom
floor. The absence of restrictive emissions on the LB7 allowed owners to get
more miles between fill ups than most people thought possible from a 3/4 ton
pickup. Most modern diesel engines have great potential for power and economy
gains over the factory set up, and the LB7 is no exception. We always like
to suggest a cold air intake kit and a free flowing exhaust system to lower
EGT's and increase MPG's and power. A good tuner will help you pull those steep
hills with ease and also get you some great power and economy gains. We also carry turbochargers as well as LB7 injectors and CP3 pumps to keep your fuel system in shape. If you don't see what you're looking for, then please give us a call! </p>","

"Fuel System Components - GM Duramax LB7","FASS® Products - GM 6.6L Duramax LB7","<p align=""left"">Air/vapor in diesel fuel is a common problem with any diesel vehicle where the fuel tank is located at a lower point than the engine. The movement of the fuel inside the tank, and the process of fuel transfer under these conditions creates as much as 10% air/vapor within the fuel. Symptoms of air/vapor can be low horsepower, poor fuel mileage, excessive smoke, injector failure, hard starting, surging and rough running. You can eliminate this problem with a FASS Fuel Air Separation System and get &quot;test cell&quot; performance under real world conditions.</p>

We carry stock replacement and high-performance injectors for the 2001 - 2004 Chevy GMC Duramax 6.6L LB7 engine. Early problems with the LB7 injectors included crankcase dilution caused by cracks that developed near the fuel inlet fitting. Bosch has fixed this problem and also made improvements to the nozzle seat retention to improve injector performance. Signs of worn Duramax injectors may include excessive smoke, rough idle or a light ""miss"", low power, and poor fuel economy. LB7 owners can extend the life of their injectors by using Stanadyne Performance Formula with every tank of fuel. Clean fuel is very important, so changing your fuel filters at the recommended intervals is critical. Adding an aftermarket fuel filter or a FASS will also extend the life of your injectors. Contact us if you don’t find the Duramax LB7 diesel injector that you’re looking for.  </p>

Heat is one of the biggest threats to overall powertrain longevity. As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

<p>GM had a good thing going with the original LB7 Duramax engine, so they wisely decided to keep changes to a minimum when they introduced the new 310HP 6.6L Duramax LLY in 2004. In 2006, the LLY featured some more extensive mechanical changes such as connecting rods, heads and injectors, but the initial LLY was basically the same engine as it's predecessor. A few things you may notice on the LLY when you pop the hood open is the introduction of some mandatory emissions equipment such as an EGR system and a variable geometry turbocharger (VGT). Ironically, better emissions didn't help the LLY's fuel economy. But fortunately, we can help you reclaim some of that with an intake kit, exhaust system or tuner. Whether you're looking for power, economy or just some filters to keep your truck serviced, then you can find it here. If you don't see what you're looking for, then please call us!</p>","

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

<p align=""left""> The feel of a performance clutch can differ greatly from the
factory clutch. You can minimize these effects and increase clutch longevity
by choosing the right clutch for your truck based on the horsepower and what
you use your truck for. A clutch designed to hold 550 hp may not act right in
a truck that only puts out 350 hp, so try to choose a clutch that closely matches
or only slightly exceeds your trucks horsepower level.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>Everyday Driving - Little or no HP improvements:<br>
</b>Stock trucks, or trucks with moderate horsepower improvements (chip, exhaust,
intake) should stick to a single disc clutch.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>Everyday Driving - Major HP Improvements<br>
</b>Trucks with significant horsepower improvements (stacked chips, performance
injectors, etc.) should consider a street dual disc clutch.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>Heavy Towing - 15,000 lbs or more</b><br>
Trucks that regularly haul or tow 15,000 lbs or more should use a street dual
disc clutch, regardless of the hp level.</p>

by choosing the right clutch for your truck based on the horsepower and what
you use your truck for. A clutch designed to hold 550 hp may not act right in
a truck that only puts out 350 hp, so try to choose a clutch that closely matches
or only slightly exceeds your trucks horsepower level.</p>

<p>Late 2007 saw the introduction of GM's latest 6.6L Duramax LMM engine. As with previous models, GM made few changes to the engine which proves once again that the Duramax is a solid engine and GM didn't see the need to make any major changes to the sturdy 360HP beast. But there were a few mandatory changes to the emissions system, most noticeably being the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) located underneath the truck. The job of the DPF is to filter the used particulates from the exhaust before they reach the air. It works very well too. But unfortunately, what's good for the air isn't necessarily good for fuel economy. As always though, we have a few tricks up our sleeve that can help you reclaim a few of those MPG's, and also help you put a few more ponies to the ground.

<div class=""QuickTitle"">AirDog Fuel Air Separation Systems for 2007 - 2010 Chevy GMC 6.6L Duramax LMM</div>

<p>The AirDog Fuel Air Separation System removes air, vapor and particulates from diesel fuel so only pure diesel fuel reaches your engine.  This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>

","<style>.wsm-cat-cat-image {display:none;}</style>
<p align=""left"">The Duramax is probably the most responsive to an aftermarket 
  lift pump. The GMC and Chevy Duramax pick-up trucks do NOT have a lift pump 
  to supply fuel to the engine. From the factory, the CP3 injection pump is the 
  truck's only means of getting fuel from the tank to the engine. If you were 
  to look at our video of How the AirDog works it will show you what happens 
  when the CP3 pump pulls fuel from the tank to the engine. Therefore because 
  the fuel is under constant suction it causes cavitation and excessive wear and 
  tear on injectors and your injection pump. Also, this is the #1 cause of low 
  rail pressure codes when adding aftermarket programmers or tuners that increase 
  the demand for fuel. By providing both constant positive fuel pressure and 100% 
  pure fuel to the engine, is where you get the added benefits of smoother and 
  quieter idle, better throttle response, increased fuel economy, better mid-range 
  through top end power and more consistent rail pressure to support both stock 
  and modified engines.</p>
<p align=""left""> Because we have a few different systems for the Duramax, install 
  difficulty and times will vary. For example; The AirDog II, FP100 and Raptor 
  pump kits do not require you to drop the tank to install the system. Because 
  of our OEM style quick connect fittings and internal pump design on the AirDog 
  II, you will simply hook the suction line to the factory fitting on the fuel 
  tank sending unit. However, if you're going to install an AirDog FP150, this 
  will require dropping the tank to install a 1/2&quot; suction tube. None of 
  the Raptor kits require a suction tube to be installed. </p>
<p align=""left"">As for the rest of the install, for fuel supply, all of the systems 
  will either hook to the factory steel feed line that runs up to the engine or 
  the line directly on the engine, we give the choice of hooking to either spot 
  based on your mechanical capabilities. On the AirDog and AirDog II systems, 
  the entrained air and un-used fuel will be sent from the system back to the 
  tank through the fuel filler tube. Also, the factory fuel filter housing will 
  remain in use when using any of the AirDog or Raptor fuel systems. </p>
<p align=""left"">Many people ask why the AirDog II, with its higher flow rate doesn't 
  need the 1/2&quot; suction tube. The reason for that is the way the AirDog II 
  is designed internally. The AirDog II recycles fuel back through the base to 
  keep the system constantly full, therefore returning less and making it a true 
  ON Demand system. Also, all of the AirDog and AirDog II systems have a built 
  in pressure port on the top of the base directly above the fuel filter, it's 
  plugged with an 1/8&quot; pipe plug and can be removed and utilized to check 
  pressure from. </p>","778480","https://usdieselparts.com/images/F102448234","AirDog Fuel Air Separation Systems for 2007 - 2010 Chevy GMC 6.6L Duramax LMM - AirDog Original - AirDog II - AirDog II-4G - Raptor Lift Pumps","AirDog, Fuel, Air, Separation, Systems,

<p>More and more diesel truck owners are realizing the benefits of removing
the restrictive Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) from their truck. By doing
so, you can expect significant power and torque gains, lower EGT's, a ""snappier""
throttle response and a significant increase in efficiency. Our DPF-Delete
Pipes can be installed in a few hours or less with basic tools in your driveway,
and the factory DPF can just as easily be re-installed if needed. An electronic
tuner capable of overriding the DPF regeneration is required when removing
your DPF. We have these available from several manufacturers, so please have
a look at those as well. All DPF-Delete products are for off-road or competition
use only, and are not legal for use on federal highways in any US state.</p>

"Fuel System Components - GM Duramax LMM","FASS® Products - GM Duramax LMM","<p align=""left"">Air/vapor in diesel fuel is a common problem with any diesel vehicle where the fuel tank is located at a lower point than the engine. The movement of the fuel inside the tank, and the process of fuel transfer under these conditions creates as much as 10% air/vapor within the fuel. Symptoms of air/vapor can be low horsepower, poor fuel mileage, excessive smoke, injector failure, hard starting, surging and rough running. You can eliminate this problem with a FASS Fuel Air Separation System and get &quot;test cell&quot; performance under real world conditions.</p>

    Performance Formula with every tank of fuel. Clean fuel is very important, 
    so changing your fuel filters at the recommended intervals is critical. Adding 
    an aftermarket fuel filter or a FASS will also extend the life of your injectors.

One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well.

B20 Biodiesel compatible. The heavy-duty Allison six-speed transmission boasts
a stronger torque converter and a larger diameter output shaft in 2011. The
exhaust brake system uses the variable vane geometry turbo technology to create
back pressure to slow the vehicle down. Duramax LML emissions utilizes an Exhaust
Gas Recirculation (EGR) with EGR cooler. The exhaust features the familiar Diesel
Particulate Filter (DPF) and active regeneration approximately every 700 miles
(300 fewer miles than last year). New to the LML emissions is a Selective Catalyst

that LML owners will have to also keep their DEF tanks filled with a liquid
solution called &quot;urea&quot;. Fortunately, LML owners can look forward to

<p align=""left"">The first Cummins 5.9L diesel engines began life in the agricultural 
  industry in the early 80's, but it wasn't until 1989 that Dodge released the 
  first Cummins 5.9L I6 turbo diesel engine in the Dodge Ram.The 89-93 B-Series 
  5.9L I6 engine featured a Bosch rotary style VE6 injection pump and Bosch direct 
  injection style injectors and a Holset turbocharger.This was a system that had 
  been proven in the agricultural and industrial industry to be reliable, powerful 
  and economical. There are still abundant performance modifications for these 
  engines that can produce some great results. In fact, we recently rad a 1993 
  5.9L with 288k miles our dyno that put out 250 RWHP with only a set of performance 
  injectors and some injection pump tuning. </p>

<p>The '94-'95 5.9L Cummins 12V Gen II engines produced 175 hp, the '96-'97 produced 215 hp and the '98 was at 235 hp. There were few changes made to the engine in the 1994 5.9L Cummins, but there were significant developments made to the fuel system. Most notable being the introduction of the durable Bosch P7100 injection pump. The massive P7100 inline injection pump allowed for more precise control over fuel delivery, and those wanting huge power gains love the P7100 pump because modifications are simple, inexpensive and impressive. Six different fuel stop plates are available that will enable power gains from 30-150 hp and 70-300 ft-lbs of torque. Our parts inventory includes a wide variety of 12V Cummins performance parts. We can recalibrate your P7100 to make further improvements to the fuel delivery and governor settings as well. We also have performance injectors to give it that extra kick. Exhaust and intake improvements will help your 5.9L breathe easier, provide lower EGTs, increase fuel economy, and boost performance. We also have factory replacement and performance turbochargers that can handle the huge horsepower increases that the Gen II engine is capable of delivering. Our selection of 12-valve Cummins performance parts is second to none. Contact us if you can’t find the part you’re looking for. </p>

<p align=""left"">Looking for some major horsepower increases? You found it! At
least 20 engineers were involved in designing the Fuel Stop Plate and Governor
controls. The fuel stop plate controls the fuel quantity of the P7100
fuel injection pump that is the heart of the Cummins engine performance. The Governor
controls the engine response to load and the maximum engine rpm <br />
<br />
We recommend this kit be installed by a qualified installer. It requires opening
up the fuel pump and precise setting of the plate to insure the proper adjustment
to prevent over fueling and damage to the engine.</p><br />

  and can destroy the VP44 injection pump. Fortunately, we can help you solve 
  this issue with a FASS or Airdog fuel pump. A High Output (HO) 245 HP version 
  was released in 2001, and the 2002 HO model was capable of producing an impressive 
  305 hp from the factory. Electronic tuning opened up a whole new world for performance 
  enthusiasts. A variety of electronic tuners are available that can easily coax 
  an additional 100 hp out of your 5.9L ISB engine. An added benefit to electronic 
  performance tuning is that increases in fuel economy can also be enjoyed. Throw 
  in a cold-air intake kit, a performance exhaust system, and you've got yourself 
  a real beast that is getting better fuel economy than it did when it left the 
  dealership. Factory replacement or performance turbochargers are also available.

<p>The AirDog Fuel Air Separation System removes air, vapor and particulates from diesel fuel so only pure diesel fuel reaches your engine.  This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>

The movement of the fuel inside the tank, and the process of fuel transfer under these conditions creates as much as 10% air/vapor within the fuel. Symptoms of air/vapor can be low horsepower, poor fuel mileage, excessive smoke, injector failure, hard starting, surging and rough running. You can eliminate this problem with a FASS Fuel Air Separation System and get &quot;test cell&quot; performance under real world conditions.</p>

However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction.

<p align=""left"">The feel of a performance clutch can differ greatly from the factory clutch. You can minimize these effects and increase clutch longevity by choosing the right clutch for your truck based on the horsepower and what you use your truck for. A clutch designed to hold 550 hp may not act right in a truck that only puts out 350 hp, so try to choose a clutch that closely matches or only slightly exceeds your trucks horsepower level.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>Everyday Driving - Little or no HP improvements:<br />
</b>Stock trucks, or trucks with moderate horsepower improvements (chip, exhaust, intake) should stick to a single disc clutch.</p>

  5.9L Cummins 24V is a workhorse of a pump, but they are prone to a few problems. 
  If you are experiencing intermittent hard starting and white smoke, then there 
  may be an electrical problem with the Electronic Diesel Control unit (EDC) module 
  on top of the pump which is caused by heat and vibration. The EDC cannot be 
  replaced, so an EDC failure will require pump replacement. Also, severe internal 
  pump damage can occur if fuel supply pressure drops to 5psi or lower, especially 
  under heavy loads or high rpm's. When this happens, you may notice low power 
  or it may seem like the engine won't rev up the way it should. Eventually the 
  diaphragm in the front of the VP44 will rupture. This results excessive vibration 
  of the timing piston which then causes damage to the front cover of the injection 
  pump. (DTC #P0216) Also, the head &amp; rotor in the pump may seize resulting 
  in a &quot;no start&quot; condition. Dodge acknowledged this issue by replacing 
  the supply pump on the the engine with a tank mounted supply pump. This is a 
  costly replacement for below average results, especially if you have made any 
  performance modifications such as a tuner or hi-performance injectors. The best 
  way to deal with this problem is by replacing the factory fuel supply pump with 
  an AirDog or FASS supply pump such as a FASS DDRP for stock engines, or a FASS 
  Titanium for modified engines. A FASS system will supply constant pressure under 
  any load to the injection pump, virtually eliminating VP44 damage due to low 
  fuel pressure.</p>

<div align=""left"">In 2003, Dodge 5.9L Cummins again met the challenge of producing 
  a 305 hp engine capable of meeting the growing emissions requirements that would 
  also be second to none in power and torque output. Cummins introduced the 325 
  hp &quot;600&quot; series engine midway through 2004 (identifiable by a red 
  or silver tag on the drivers side of the engine that shows the torque rating 
  at &quot;600&quot;). The &quot;610&quot; model was released in 2005, and was 
  capable of an impressive 325 hp and 610 lb-ft of torque. The 5.9L Cummins 610 
  remained unchanged through 2006 and the early 2007 5.9L models. These were the 
  first Cummins 5.9L 24-Valve engine to feature the Bosch Common Rail injection 
  system which gets it's steady supply of fuel from a CP3 high pressure supply 
  pump. This new technology doesn't come at a cheap price, and that's why we always 
  recommend a FASS system to protect your investment. A variety of electronic 
  tuners are available that can easily squeeze an additional 100 hp out of your 
  5.9L engine. An added benefit to electronic performance tuning is that increases 
  in fuel economy can also be enjoyed. Throw in a cold-air intake kit, a performance 
  exhaust system, and you've got yourself a real beast that is getting better 
  fuel economy than it did when it left the dealership. Factory replacement or 
  performance turbochargers are also available</div>","<div align=""left"">

<p>The AirDog Fuel Air Separation System removes air, vapor and particulates from diesel fuel so only pure diesel fuel reaches your engine.  This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>

The movement of the fuel inside the tank, and the process of fuel transfer under these conditions creates as much as 10% air/vapor within the fuel. Symptoms of air/vapor can be low horsepower, poor fuel mileage, excessive smoke, injector failure, hard starting, surging and rough running. You can eliminate this problem with a FASS Fuel Air Separation System and get &quot;test cell&quot; performance under real world conditions.</p>

Heat is one of the biggest threats to overall powertrain longevity. As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

a truck that only puts out 350 hp, so try to choose a clutch that closely matches

  <p align=""left"">In late 2007, Cummins bumped the displacement from 5.9L up to a healthy 6.7L engine. The '08-'12 6.7L engine cranks out 350 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque, and 2013-up puts out 385hp right off the showroom floor. The power is put to a Mercedes G56 6-spd manual transmission, or a Chrysler 6-spd 68RFE automatic transmission. Thanks to changes in the common rail fuel system, the engine runs noticeably quieter. 2007 also marked the year that Dodge introduced the diesel particulate filter (DPF), an Exhaust Gas Recirculation system (EGR) and a Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT) to assist with meeting strict emissions regulations. Unfortunately, sacrifices to power and fuel economy are made in the process of meeting emissions. We can help you recover some MPGs and power from your 6.7L engine with a variety of 6.7L Cummins performance aftermarket products. If you don’t see the 6.7L Cummins performance part that you’re looking for, contact us for assistance.</p>

Symptoms of air/vapor can be low horsepower, poor fuel mileage, excessive smoke, injector failure, hard starting, surging and rough running.

"","Ford","We carry Ford Power Stroke parts for a variety of Ford models dating back to 1983. Ford entered into the light truck diesel market in the early 80's with their Navistar 6.9L and 7.3L IDI naturally aspirated V8 engines which were a huge success for Ford. In 1994 they released the 210 hp Navistar 7.3L Power Stroke engine. Navistar utilized an advanced Hydraulically Activated, Electronically Controlled Unit Injector, or ""HEUI"" for short. Although this unique fuel system seemed years ahead of its time, it had already been proven in the heavy truck market by the time Ford got their hands on it. In 1999, the 7.3L received an intercooler and changes were made to the turbo and injectors. In 2001, we saw power increase to 250-275 hp. The first major modifications to the Ford Power Stroke were made in 2003 with the arrival of the 325 hp 6.0L Power Stroke, and the 7.3L was officially discontinued in 2004. A Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT), Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) and Overhead Valves (OHV) were utilized on the new 6.0L to keep up with emissions demands. 2008 saw the arrival of the 350 hp 6.4L Twin-Turbo Common Rail engine. Advanced emissions make it one of the cleanest running diesel engines ever produced, but owners still report poor fuel mileage. We offer Power Stroke diesel parts that can improve your vehicle’s performance. In 2011 Ford introduced the 6.7L ""Scorpion"" which is the first Power Stroke engine to utilize the Bosch Common Rail injection system. Check out our inventory of Ford Power Stroke parts today to see if we have what you’re looking for.","<p><b>Power Stroke</b> is a line of diesel engines found in Ford Diesel trucks, Ford Excursion SUVs, Ford Econoline vans, Ford LCF commercial vehicles and the Brazilian Ford Ranger. The V8 engines were produced by Navistar International Corp. until 2010 when Ford decided to build their diesel engine completely in-house. The Power Stroke engines compete primarily in the United States full-size pickup truck market with the Duramax V8 from General Motors/Isuzu and the B series straight 6 from Cummins.</p>","778855","https://usdieselparts.com/images/F93636894","Ford Diesel Performance Parts for Ford 7.3L, 6.0L, 6.4L and 6.7L Power Stroke.

"Ford","1983-1993 Ford IDI Diesel ","<p style=""text-align: left"">Ford introduced the first 6.9L diesel engine for their light duty trucks in 1983. The naturally aspirated, indirect injection (IDI) engine featured a Stanadyne DB2 injection pump, and put out a very respectable 170 horsepower for the day. The 6.9L was bored out to 7.3L in 1987. The original 7.3L diesel was a non-turbo charged IDI engine. It was followed shortly after by a turbocharged version, but otherwise remained basically the same throughout 1993. We have been working with these engines since their introduction and can help you with everything from glow plugs to a complete re-manufactured engine. If you're looking for a replacement injection pump or injectors, then you have come to the right place. There are very few performance modifications available for the 6.9L and 7.3L IDI engines. But if you're a dedicated 6.9L or 7.3L IDI owner, then check out our Banks Sidewinder Performance Packages.

    A common problem with the Ford 6.9L and 7.3L IDI engines is hard starting due to air in the fuel supply lines. Replacing the filter o-rings whenever you
    replace the fuel filter is important, but the rubber grommets on the fuel supply line leading from the filter head to the fuel pump can also cause
    problems, so you might want to replace those as well. Those are included in the pump installation kit that can also be found on this page. The heater
    o-ring located at the top of the filter assembly is also prone to leaking. You can purchase the heater o-ring (p/n E8TZ-9K342-A) or the entire heater (p/n
F2TZ-9J294-A) from your local Ford dealer. Air in the fuel supply line can also be caused by a defective    <a href=""http://www.usdieselparts.com/index.cfm/product/24523"">fuel supply pump</a>.

<p align=""left""> The feel of a performance clutch can differ greatly from the
factory clutch. You can minimize these effects and increase clutch longevity
by choosing the right clutch for your truck based on the horsepower and what
you use your truck for. A clutch designed to hold 550 hp may not act right in
a truck that only puts out 350 hp, so try to choose a clutch that closely matches
or only slightly exceeds your trucks horsepower level.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>Everyday Driving - Little or no HP improvements:<br>
</b>Stock trucks, or trucks with moderate horsepower improvements (chip, exhaust,
intake) should stick to a single disc clutch.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>Everyday Driving - Major HP Improvements<br>
</b>Trucks with significant horsepower improvements (stacked chips, performance
injectors, etc.) should consider a street dual disc clutch.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>Heavy Towing - 15,000 lbs or more</b><br>
Trucks that regularly haul or tow 15,000 lbs or more should use a street dual
disc clutch, regardless of the hp level.</p>
<p align=""left""> <b>Competition Drag or Pulling</b><br />
Any truck used for competition drag racing or sled-pulling should use an SFI
approved multi-disc clutch. </p>","","778872","https://usdieselparts.com/images/F98981515","Clutch Kits for 1987 - 1994 Ford 7.3L IDI","Clutch, Kits, Ford, 7.3L, IDI","Clutch Kits Ford 6.9L 7.3L IDI","500","Ford>1983-1993 Ford IDI Diesel >Transmissions - 89-93 Ford 6.9L 7.3L IDI>Clutch Kits - 87-94 Ford 7.3L IDI ","2013-05-31 17:38:45",""

The first 7.3L Power Stroke produced 250 hp and 525 lb-ft of torque. The heart of the new design was a &quot;single shot&quot; HEUI (hydraulic electronic unit injector) fuel injection system that ran a 15&deg; high pressure oil pump (HPOP) to create fuel injection pressures. The 1994 - 1997 7.3L Power Strokes are still hugely popular and there is an abundance of aftermarket performance options to choose from. Cold air intake kits and performance exhaust systems will get you a few extra ponies while lowering EGT's and increasing fuel economy. A performance tuner can offer some serious hp gains and also help increase your fuel mileage. Factory and hi-performance turbochargers are also available. We also have everything from high pressure oil pumps, glow plugs and filters to keep your Power Stroke on the road.

Heat is one of the biggest threats to overall powertrain longevity. As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

There were a few notable changes made to the 7.3L Power Stroke in 1999. An intercooler was added to cool the charged air from the turbocharger. The cooler, denser air helps increase horsepower and reduce EGTs. The turbine housing was changed to a .84 A/R and a wastegate was also added. The single shot HEUI injectors were changed to split shot design, and the high-pressure oil pump was advanced to 17° to help increase the necessary fuel pressure. The 1998 7.3L PS was rated at 225 hp, and the 1999 - 2000 models were rated at 235 hp. 2001 - 2003 saw another boost to about 250-275 hp from the factory. We carry an abundance of aftermarket performance options to choose from for the 1998-2003 7.3L Power Strokes. Cold air intake kits and performance exhaust systems will get you a few extra ponies while lowering EGT's and increasing fuel economy. A performance tuner can offer some serious hp gains and also help increase your fuel mileage. Factory and hi-performance turbochargers are also available. Our inventory of stock and performance parts for 7.3L Power Stroke engines includes high-pressure oil pumps, glow plugs, filters, engine kits, fuel injectors, turbochargers, complete engines and more to keep your Power Stroke on the road.

<div class=""QuickTitle"">AirDog Fuel Air Separation Systems for 1998-2003 Ford 7.3L Power Stroke Diesel</div>

<p>The AirDog Fuel Air Separation System removes air, vapor and particulates from diesel fuel so only pure diesel fuel reaches your engine.  This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>

The movement of the fuel inside the tank, and the process of fuel transfer under these conditions creates as much as 10% air/vapor within the fuel. Symptoms of air/vapor can be low horsepower, poor fuel mileage, excessive smoke, injector failure, hard starting, surging and rough running. You can eliminate this problem with a FASS Fuel Air Separation System and get &quot;test cell&quot; performance under real world conditions.</p>

The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction.

<p align=""left""> The feel of a performance clutch can differ greatly from the
factory clutch. You can minimize these effects and increase clutch longevity
by choosing the right clutch for your truck based on the horsepower and what
you use your truck for. A clutch designed to hold 550 hp may not act right in
a truck that only puts out 350 hp, so try to choose a clutch that closely matches
or only slightly exceeds your trucks horsepower level.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>Everyday Driving - Little or no HP improvements:<br>
</b>Stock trucks, or trucks with moderate horsepower improvements (chip, exhaust,
intake) should stick to a single disc clutch.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>Everyday Driving - Major HP Improvements<br>
</b>Trucks with significant horsepower improvements (stacked chips, performance
injectors, etc.) should consider a street dual disc clutch.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>Heavy Towing - 15,000 lbs or more</b><br>
Trucks that regularly haul or tow 15,000 lbs or more should use a street dual
disc clutch, regardless of the hp level.</p>
<p align=""left""> <b>Competition Drag or Pulling</b><br />
Any truck used for competition drag racing or sled-pulling should use an SFI
approved multi-disc clutch. </p>","","778972","https://usdieselparts.com/images/F98994955","Heavy Duty Clutch Kits - 1998-2003 Ford 7.3L Power Stroke","Clutch, Kits, Ford, 7.3L, Power, Stroke, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003","Heavy Duty Clutch Kits - 1998-2003 Ford 7.3L Power Stroke","499","Ford>1994-2003 Ford 7.3L Power Stroke>1999 - 2003 7.3L Ford Power Stroke>Transmissions - 99-03 Ford 7.3L>Heavy Duty Clutch Kits

<p>The AirDog Fuel Air Separation System removes air, vapor and particulates from diesel fuel so only pure diesel fuel reaches your engine.  This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>

<p>Throttle Sensitivity Booster from BD Power - Modern vehicles utilize an accelerator pedal position sensor to control engine fueling. Many of these vehicles respond slowly and have poor throttle sensitivity. Much of this is actually caused by the factory programming within the ECM. The BD Throttle Sensitivity Booster corrects this by making the pedal more sensitive and making the vehicle more responsive.</p>

<p>The module can be set to a low or high increase in sensitivity depending on driver preference.

be traced to a chain reaction that starts with the <b>Engine Oil Cooler</b>
failure. The engine oil cooler has small narrow, flat cooling tubes that are
easily clogged by foreign material in the coolant. Engine coolant flows through
the engine oil cooler first and then to the EGR cooler. So if the engine oil
cooler becomes clogged, then engine oil may become overheated causing poor performance
and eventually engine damage. The restricted downstream flow of coolant will
also cause coolant within the EGR cooler to flash-boil and spill coolant into
the overflow tank. Eventually the overflow tank overfills, coolant is lost and
the engine will overheat. In time, the <a href=""index.cfm/category/833/egr-cooler-delete-kits-60l-power-stroke.cfm"">EGR

"2003-2007 6.0L Ford Power Stroke","Heads, Head Studs & Gaskets - 03-07 Ford 6.0L","<p align=""left"">Looking for replacement cylinder heads for 6.0L Power Stroke engines? The head studs on the 6.0L Power Stroke are susceptible to failures due to a number of reasons. A leaking EGR Cooler will contaminate the cylinders with coolant, causing a hydraulic effect that will stretch the head studs and cause the head gaskets to fail. Also, the head studs pass through an aluminum carrier and a cast-iron head. The aluminum and the cast iron expand and contract at different rates which can weaken the factory grade head studs and hamper their ability to do their job. Additionally, the aluminum carrier does not allow sufficient clamping force with the factory head studs to withstand the extreme pressures that the 6.0L engine produces. We carry a wide selection of replacement cylinder heads for 6.0L Power Stroke engines.</p>
<p align=""left"">In addition to upgrading your Engine Oil Cooler and installing an EGR Cooler Delete Kit, we recommend installing a set of ARP head studs and Black Diamond head gaskets that will not only hold up to the extreme pressures that the 6.0L engine demands, but will also withstand aftermarket turbocharger boost pressures beyond anything that your factory replacement heads studs and head gaskets can offer.

Heat is one of the biggest threats to overall powertrain longevity. As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

"Ford","2008-2010 6.4L Ford Power Stroke","<p align=""left""><br>The
6.4L Power Stroke was released in 2008 and produced an impressive 350 hp from
the factory. The design changes to the 6.4L were made primarily to meet new
emissions requirements. The 6.4L Power Stroke is a clean and quiet running engine
and the first in it's class to feature factory twin turbochargers to help reduce
turbo lag. The 6.4L is also the first Power Stroke engine that utilizes a Common
Rail injection system and a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) regenerative system
that burns off excess soot and ash. While the DPF does a good job of filtering
out particulates, it has had a negative affect on fuel mileage. Fortunately,
there is an abundance of aftermarket performance options to choose from for
the 6.4L Power Strokes that will also help increase power and mileage. Cold
air intake kits and performance exhaust systems will get you a few extra ponies
while lowering EGT's and increasing fuel mileage. A performance tuner can offer
some serious hp gains and also help increase your mpg's.</p>","<p>The 6.4 liter also has a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and dual EGR coolers which are capable of reducing exhaust gas temps by up to 1000 degrees before they reach the EGR valve and mix with the intake charge. The Diesel Particulate Filter traps soot and particulates from the exhaust and virtually eliminates the black smoke that most diesel engines expel upon acceleration. The engine computer is programmed to periodically inject extra fuel in the exhaust stroke of the engine (known as a ""regeneration"" in F-Series) to burn off soot that accumulates in the DPF. This engine must run on Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) fuel which has no more than 15 ppm sulfur content; using regular diesel fuel will result in emission equipment malfunctions and violate manufacturer warranties.</p>","779056","https://usdieselparts.com/images/F76369888","Parts for 2008 - 2010 6.4L Ford Power Stroke","2008, 2009, 2010, 6.4L, Ford, Power, Stroke, Powerstroke, diesel, parts","6.4L Ford Power Stroke Parts","460","Ford>2008-2010 6.4L Ford Power Stroke","2013-05-31 17:39:29",""

<p>The AirDog Fuel Air Separation System removes air, vapor and particulates from diesel fuel so only pure diesel fuel reaches your engine.  This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>

the overall size of each system. </p>
<p align=""left""> Heavy Duty Series - 14&quot; height<br>
 Titanium Series - 12-1/8&quot; height<br>
 Platinum Series - 9.5"" height</p>
<p align=""left"">Heavy Duty series filters are rated at 40k miles, and the Titanium
series filters are rated at 30k miles. Because of their larger size, the Heavy
Duty series kits are more commonly used for heavy duty trucks or race/competition
vehicles. Titanium series kits are usually a better choice for most light duty
trucks. Platinum series kits are also great for most light duty trucks where
mounting space is limited. </p>","","779083","https://usdieselparts.com/images/F85415497","FASS Heavy Duty series high performance lift pumps fit 2008-2010 Ford 6.4L Power Stroke","FASS, Heavy, Duty, Series, Ford, 6.4L, Power Stroke","FASS Heavy Duty Ford 6.4L Power Stroke","500","Ford>2008-2010 6.4L Ford Power Stroke>Fuel System Components - 08-10 Ford 6.4L>FASS® Products - 08-10 Ford 6.4L>FASS Heavy Duty Series - 08-10 Ford 6.4L","2013-05-31 17:39:35","1"

The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction.

codenamed the latest 6.7L Power Stroke engine the ""Scorpion"" due to the turbo
placement on top of the engine. The Scorpion features many groundbreaking changes
in 2011, such as a compacted graphite iron (CGI) block for greater strength and
reduced weight, reverse flow aluminum cylinder heads with exhaust ports located
in the lifter valley, dual water jackets, six head bolts per cylinder, and
a 29,000 psi high-pressure Bosch Common Rail fuel system, which is a first for
any Power Stroke engine. The system delivers up to five injection events per cylinder
per cycle using eight-hole piezo injectors.
This 6.7L Scorpion also supports B20 biodiesel. Honeywells unique single-sequential turbocharger
features a double-sided compressor wheel mounted on a single shaft. It combines
the benefits of a small turbocharger for quicker response and a large turbocharger
with the ability to compress and force more air into the engine for more power
all in one unit. Emission controls include exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), Denoxtronic
based Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) from Bosch, and a Diesel Particulate
Filter (DPF). The new engine control software bumped the horsepower to 400 hp
@ 2800 rpm and 800 lbft @ 1600 rpm.

"","Volkswagen","<h3>Volkswagen TDI Diesel High Performance Parts and Accessories</h3>
<p>The Volkswagen TDI diesel engine was introduced by VAG in 1989 and was instantly recognized as an economical, yet powerful diesel engine for a mid-sized passenger car. The design featured a Turbocharger and Direct Injection fuel system by Bosch. The advanced turbocharger system increases airflow, and an intercooler lowers the intake air temperatures of the compressed air from the turbo, allowing for greater engine fuel efficiency, more power and torque and lower emissions. </p>
<p align=""left"">In 2009, a Volkswagen Passat set a fuel economy record by averaging 67.9 miles per gallon in a tour of the 48 contiguous states. More recently, a 2012 Volkswagen Passat TDI SE was driven 1,626.1 miles from Houston, TX to Sterling, Va., breaking the Guinness record for the longest drive in a passenger car on a single tank of diesel fuel. The TDI 1.9L is no slouch either.

</p>
<p align=""left"">
    The feel of a performance clutch can differ greatly from the factory clutch. You can minimize these effects and increase clutch longevity by choosing the
    right clutch for your truck based on the horsepower and what you use your truck for. A clutch designed to hold 550 hp may not act right in a truck that
    only puts out 350 hp, so try to choose a clutch that closely matches or only slightly exceeds your trucks horsepower level.
</p>
<p align=""left"">
    <strong>
        Everyday Driving - Little or no HP improvements:
        <br/>
    </strong>
    Stock trucks, or trucks with moderate horsepower improvements (chip, exhaust, intake) should stick to a single disc clutch.
</p>
<p align=""left"">
    <strong>
        Everyday Driving - Major HP Improvements
        <br/>
    </strong>
    Trucks with significant horsepower improvements (stacked chips, performance injectors, etc.) should consider a street dual disc clutch.
</p>
<p align=""left"">
    <strong>Heavy Towing - 15,000 lbs or more</strong>
    <br/>
    Trucks that regularly haul or tow 15,000 lbs or more should use a street dual disc clutch, regardless of the hp level.
</p>
<p align=""left"">
    <strong>Competition Drag or Pulling</strong>
    <br/>
    Any truck used for competition drag racing or sled-pulling should use an SFI approved multi-disc clutch.

Heat is one of the biggest threats to overall powertrain longevity. As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

    The feel of a performance clutch can differ greatly from the factory clutch. You can minimize these effects and increase clutch longevity by choosing the
    right clutch for your truck based on the horsepower and what you use your truck for. A clutch designed to hold 550 hp may not act right in a truck that
    only puts out 350 hp, so try to choose a clutch that closely matches or only slightly exceeds your trucks horsepower level.

    <strong>
        Everyday Driving - Little or no HP improvements:

    <strong>
        Everyday Driving - Major HP Improvements
        <br/>
    </strong>
    Trucks with significant horsepower improvements (stacked chips, performance injectors, etc.) should consider a street dual disc clutch.
</p>
<p align=""left"">
    <strong>Heavy Towing - 15,000 lbs or more</strong>
    <br/>
    Trucks that regularly haul or tow 15,000 lbs or more should use a street dual disc clutch, regardless of the hp level.

    <strong>Turbocharger Failure:</strong>
    <br/>
    When you shut your turbocharged engine off immediately without allowing it to cool down first, then oil is allowed to sit uncirculated directly on the hot
    turbocharger shaft and bearings. This oil cooks into a carbon coating on the heated components. Eventually this carbon coating will build up and cause the
    turbocharger bearings to seize. This results in turbo failure and potential engine damage.
</p>
<p align=""left"">
    <strong>The Solution is simple:</strong>
    <br/>
    This can easily be solved by installing a Diesel Turbo Lifesaver (DTLS). Once the DTLS is installed, you don't have to do anything. You simply turn off the

<p>The AirDog Fuel Air Separation System removes air, vapor and particulates from diesel fuel so only pure diesel fuel reaches your engine.  This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>","","802770","https://usdieselparts.com/images/F100641949","AirDog Fuel Air Separation Systems for 2007+ Dodge 6.7L Cummins - Original Airdog - AirDog II - AirDog II-4G - Raptor Lift Pumps","AirDog, Fuel, Air, Separation, system, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, Dodge, 6.7L, Cummins, good, best, II, 2, 4G, filter, lift, pump","AirDog Fuel Air Separation Systems for 2007+ Dodge 6.7L Cummins Diesel","380","Dodge>2007.5 - 2018 6.7L Dodge Cummins>Fuel System Components - 2007.5-2018 Dodge 6.7L>AirDog® Products - 2007-2018 Dodge 6.7L","2013-06-26 20:23:06",""

The movement of the fuel inside the tank, and the process of fuel transfer under these conditions creates as much as 10% air/vapor within the fuel. Symptoms of air/vapor can be low horsepower, poor fuel mileage, excessive smoke, injector failure, hard starting, surging and rough running. You can eliminate this problem with a FASS Fuel Air Separation System and get &quot;test cell&quot; performance under real world conditions.</p>

    The feel of a performance clutch can differ greatly from the factory clutch. You can minimize these effects and increase clutch longevity by choosing the
    right clutch for your truck based on the horsepower and what you use your truck for. A clutch designed to hold 550 hp may not act right in a truck that
    only puts out 350 hp, so try to choose a clutch that closely matches or only slightly exceeds your trucks horsepower level.
</p>
<p align=""left"">
    <strong>
        Everyday Driving - Little or no HP improvements:
        <br/>
    </strong>
    Stock trucks, or trucks with moderate horsepower improvements (chip, exhaust, intake) should stick to a single disc clutch.
</p>

    <strong>
        Everyday Driving - Major HP Improvements
        <br/>
    </strong>
    Trucks with significant horsepower improvements (stacked chips, performance injectors, etc.) should consider a street dual disc clutch.

<p align=""left"">
    <strong>Heavy Towing - 15,000 lbs or more</strong>
    <br/>
    Trucks that regularly haul or tow 15,000 lbs or more should use a street dual disc clutch, regardless of the hp level.

    <strong>Competition Drag or Pulling</strong>
    <br/>
    Any truck used for competition drag racing or sled-pulling should use an SFI approved multi-disc clutch.

<p>The AirDog Fuel Air Separation System removes air, vapor and particulates from diesel fuel so only pure diesel fuel reaches your engine.  This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>","
<p align=""left"">The Duramax is probably the most responsive to an aftermarket 
  lift pump. The GMC and Chevy Duramax pick-up trucks do NOT have a lift pump 
  to supply fuel to the engine. From the factory, the CP3 injection pump is the 
  truck's only means of getting fuel from the tank to the engine. If you were 
  to look at our video of How the AirDog works it will show you what happens 
  when the CP3 pump pulls fuel from the tank to the engine. Therefore because 
  the fuel is under constant suction it causes cavitation and excessive wear and 
  tear on injectors and your injection pump. Also, this is the #1 cause of low 
  rail pressure codes when adding aftermarket programmers or tuners that increase 
  the demand for fuel. By providing both constant positive fuel pressure and 100% 
  pure fuel to the engine, is where you get the added benefits of smoother and 
  quieter idle, better throttle response, increased fuel economy, better mid-range 
  through top end power and more consistent rail pressure to support both stock 
  and modified engines.</p>
<p align=""left""> Because we have a few different systems for the Duramax, install 
  difficulty and times will vary. For example; The AirDog II, FP100 and Raptor 
  pump kits do not require you to drop the tank to install the system. Because 
  of our OEM style quick connect fittings and internal pump design on the AirDog 
  II, you will simply hook the suction line to the factory fitting on the fuel 
  tank sending unit. However, if you're going to install an AirDog FP150, this 
  will require dropping the tank to install a 1/2&quot; suction tube. None of 
  the Raptor kits require a suction tube to be installed. </p>
<p align=""left"">As for the rest of the install, for fuel supply, all of the systems 
  will either hook to the factory steel feed line that runs up to the engine or 
  the line directly on the engine, we give the choice of hooking to either spot 
  based on your mechanical capabilities. On the AirDog and AirDog II systems, 
  the entrained air and un-used fuel will be sent from the system back to the 
  tank through the fuel filler tube. Also, the factory fuel filter housing will 
  remain in use when using any of the AirDog or Raptor fuel systems. </p>
<p align=""left"">Many people ask why the AirDog II, with its higher flow rate doesn't 
  need the 1/2&quot; suction tube. The reason for that is the way the AirDog II 
  is designed internally. The AirDog II recycles fuel back through the base to 
  keep the system constantly full, therefore returning less and making it a true 
  ON Demand system. Also, all of the AirDog and AirDog II systems have a built

"Fuel System Components - GM Duramax LLY","FASS® Products - GM 6.6L Duramax LLY","<p align=""left"">Air/vapor in diesel fuel is a common problem with any diesel vehicle where the fuel tank is located at a lower point than the engine. The movement of the fuel inside the tank, and the process of fuel transfer under these conditions creates as much as 10% air/vapor within the fuel. Symptoms of air/vapor can be low horsepower, poor fuel mileage, excessive smoke, injector failure, hard starting, surging and rough running. You can eliminate this problem with a FASS Fuel Air Separation System and get &quot;test cell&quot; performance under real world conditions.</p>

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

    The FASS Titanium Series (formerly called the 95-series) is the most effective and widely used Fuel Air Separation System of its kind for light duty
    trucks. Each Titanium system consists of a high performance fuel supply pump, a 30k mile fuel filter and water separator. The fuel pressure and volume is
    far superior than the OEM fuel pump and helps protect your fuel system from potential damage, provides easier starting, smoother acceleration and a
    snappier throttle response. The separation of air vapor increases power and fuel economy.

                        MBRP Exhaust tips give you the opportunity to really personalize your high performance exhaust system. Whether you choose the Mirror
                        polished T304 stainless steel exhaust tip or the Black finish T304 stainless steel exhaust tip, each ensures that they keep on looking
                        great long after cheaper chrome tips have rusted through. They are easy to clean up and easy to install. The clampless, no-weld design
                        makes it easy to have the exhaust tip that suits you best and the ability to adjust the angle or remove the exhaust tip with ease.

<div class=""QuickTitle"">AirDog Fuel Air Separation Systems for 2006 - 2007 Chevy GMC 6.6L Duramax LBZ</div>

<p>The AirDog Fuel Air Separation System removes air, vapor and particulates from diesel fuel so only pure diesel fuel reaches your engine.  This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>
","<style>.wsm-cat-cat-image {display:none;}</style>
<p align=""left"">The Duramax is probably the most responsive to an aftermarket 
  lift pump. The GMC and Chevy Duramax pick-up trucks do NOT have a lift pump 
  to supply fuel to the engine. From the factory, the CP3 injection pump is the 
  truck's only means of getting fuel from the tank to the engine. If you were 
  to look at our video of How the AirDog works it will show you what happens 
  when the CP3 pump pulls fuel from the tank to the engine. Therefore because 
  the fuel is under constant suction it causes cavitation and excessive wear and 
  tear on injectors and your injection pump. Also, this is the #1 cause of low 
  rail pressure codes when adding aftermarket programmers or tuners that increase 
  the demand for fuel. By providing both constant positive fuel pressure and 100% 
  pure fuel to the engine, is where you get the added benefits of smoother and 
  quieter idle, better throttle response, increased fuel economy, better mid-range 
  through top end power and more consistent rail pressure to support both stock 
  and modified engines.</p>
<p align=""left""> Because we have a few different systems for the Duramax, install 
  difficulty and times will vary. For example; The AirDog II, FP100 and Raptor 
  pump kits do not require you to drop the tank to install the system. Because 
  of our OEM style quick connect fittings and internal pump design on the AirDog 
  II, you will simply hook the suction line to the factory fitting on the fuel 
  tank sending unit. However, if you're going to install an AirDog FP150, this 
  will require dropping the tank to install a 1/2&quot; suction tube. None of 
  the Raptor kits require a suction tube to be installed. </p>
<p align=""left"">As for the rest of the install, for fuel supply, all of the systems 
  will either hook to the factory steel feed line that runs up to the engine or 
  the line directly on the engine, we give the choice of hooking to either spot 
  based on your mechanical capabilities. On the AirDog and AirDog II systems, 
  the entrained air and un-used fuel will be sent from the system back to the 
  tank through the fuel filler tube. Also, the factory fuel filter housing will 
  remain in use when using any of the AirDog or Raptor fuel systems. </p>
<p align=""left"">Many people ask why the AirDog II, with its higher flow rate doesn't 
  need the 1/2&quot; suction tube. The reason for that is the way the AirDog II 
  is designed internally. The AirDog II recycles fuel back through the base to 
  keep the system constantly full, therefore returning less and making it a true 
  ON Demand system. Also, all of the AirDog and AirDog II systems have a built 
  in pressure port on the top of the base directly above the fuel filter, it's 
  plugged with an 1/8&quot; pipe plug and can be removed and utilized to check 
  pressure from. </p>","892298","https://usdieselparts.com/images/F142516421","AirDog Fuel Air Separation Systems for 2006 - 2007 Chevy GMC 6.6L Duramax LBZ - Original Airdog - AirDog II - AirDog II-4G - Raptor Lift Pumps","AirDog, fuel, prep, preparator, system, lift, pump, filter, separator, GM, GMC, Chevy, Duramax, 6.6, 6.6L, 2006, 2007, diesel, II, 2, 4G, G4, Raptor","","430","Chevy / GMC>2006 - 2007 6.6L Duramax LBZ>Fuel System Components - GM Duramax LBZ>AirDog® Products - GM 6.6L Duramax LBZ","2013-09-05 20:37:41",""

The movement of the fuel inside the tank, and the process of fuel transfer under these conditions creates as much as 10% air/vapor within the fuel. Symptoms of air/vapor can be low horsepower, poor fuel mileage, excessive smoke, injector failure, hard starting, surging and rough running.

<div class=""QuickTitle"">AirDog Fuel Air Separation Systems for 2011+ Chevy GMC 6.6L Duramax LML LGH</div>

<p>The AirDog Fuel Air Separation System removes air, vapor and particulates from diesel fuel so only pure diesel fuel reaches your engine.  This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>


","<style>.wsm-cat-cat-image {display:none;}</style>
<p align=""left"">The Duramax is probably the most responsive to an aftermarket 
  lift pump. The GMC and Chevy Duramax pick-up trucks do NOT have a lift pump 
  to supply fuel to the engine. From the factory, the CP3 injection pump is the 
  truck's only means of getting fuel from the tank to the engine. If you were 
  to look at our video of How the AirDog works it will show you what happens 
  when the CP3 pump pulls fuel from the tank to the engine. Therefore because 
  the fuel is under constant suction it causes cavitation and excessive wear and 
  tear on injectors and your injection pump. Also, this is the #1 cause of low 
  rail pressure codes when adding aftermarket programmers or tuners that increase 
  the demand for fuel. By providing both constant positive fuel pressure and 100% 
  pure fuel to the engine, is where you get the added benefits of smoother and 
  quieter idle, better throttle response, increased fuel economy, better mid-range 
  through top end power and more consistent rail pressure to support both stock 
  and modified engines.</p>
<p align=""left""> Because we have a few different systems for the Duramax, install 
  difficulty and times will vary. For example; The AirDog II, FP100 and Raptor 
  pump kits do not require you to drop the tank to install the system. Because 
  of our OEM style quick connect fittings and internal pump design on the AirDog 
  II, you will simply hook the suction line to the factory fitting on the fuel 
  tank sending unit. However, if you're going to install an AirDog FP150, this 
  will require dropping the tank to install a 1/2&quot; suction tube. None of 
  the Raptor kits require a suction tube to be installed. </p>
<p align=""left"">As for the rest of the install, for fuel supply, all of the systems 
  will either hook to the factory steel feed line that runs up to the engine or 
  the line directly on the engine, we give the choice of hooking to either spot 
  based on your mechanical capabilities. On the AirDog and AirDog II systems, 
  the entrained air and un-used fuel will be sent from the system back to the 
  tank through the fuel filler tube. Also, the factory fuel filter housing will 
  remain in use when using any of the AirDog or Raptor fuel systems. </p>
<p align=""left"">Many people ask why the AirDog II, with its higher flow rate doesn't 
  need the 1/2&quot; suction tube. The reason for that is the way the AirDog II 
  is designed internally. The AirDog II recycles fuel back through the base to 
  keep the system constantly full, therefore returning less and making it a true 
  ON Demand system. Also, all of the AirDog and AirDog II systems have a built 
  in pressure port on the top of the base directly above the fuel filter, it's 
  plugged with an 1/8&quot; pipe plug and can be removed and utilized to check 
  pressure from. </p>","1001239","https://usdieselparts.com/images/F101140076","AirDog Fuel Air Separation Systems for 2011+ Chevy GMC 6.6L Duramax LML LGH Diesel Trucks","AirDog, Fuel, Air, Separation, Systems, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, Chevy, GMC, 6.6L, Duramax, LML, LGH","AirDog Products LML LGH","450","Chevy / GMC>2011 - 2016 6.6L Duramax LML>Fuel System Components - GM Duramax LML>AirDog® Fuel Air Separation Systems - GM Duramax LML LGH","2014-03-05 20:23:27",""

    The Bosch name is synonymous with quality when it comes to diesel fuel injection. 
    Those who insist upon the best will demand the Bosch name every time. When 
    you choose Bosch injectors for your Duramax, you'll get more power, 
    better mileage, smoother idle, increased longevity and a superior warranty from the best name in the diesel industry.</p>

<p>For simplicity, we've also added the common parts to this category that you should change out when rebuilding or installing a new set of injectors such as fuel filters, O-rings and connector tubes.  A clean fuel system ensures the longest life possible for your injectors which is why we also suggest a fuel purification system such as a <a href=""http://usdieselparts.com/c-778797"">FASS</a> or <a href=""http://usdieselparts.com/c-802770"">AirDog</a> system.</p>

Heat is one of the biggest threats to overall powertrain longevity. As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

But, have you ever wondered, can't there be a better option than a frame mounted pump and a pickup tube that can lead to quarter tank issues? Why can't someone just build a better lift pump that just mounts in the stock in-tank location? Well, that time has come, introducing the PowerFlo Lift Pump from Fleece Performance Engineering.</p>

<p>No more noisy lift pumps, cutting holes in your fuel tank, or quarter tank issues. Fleece's drop-in lift pump allows for silent operation, utilizes the factory connections for an easy installation and its active fill bucket technology eliminates the need for a draw straw or tank sump. The PowerFlo Lift Pump operates with two OEM quality gerotor pumps that have surpassed 12,000 hours of durability testing and together flow 170 GPH @ 15 psi, making the PowerFlo Lift Pump capable of supporting 800+ RWHP.</p>","","1209226","https://usdieselparts.com/images/F144553505","","","Fleece Performance - 2007.5+ Dodge 6.7L","300","Dodge>2007.5 - 2018 6.7L Dodge Cummins>Fuel System Components - 2007.5-2018 Dodge 6.7L>Fleece Performance - 2007-2018 Dodge 6.7L","2017-12-20 15:32:30",""

The 48RE transmissions were really designed for about 570 lb-ft of torque from the factory. Meanwhile, the standard Cummins in this year range has peaked at 610 lb-ft from the factory. The limits of the 48RE transmission are quickly understood especially when performance modifications have been added to the vehicle.  Randy’s Transmissions understand the limits of the 48RE and really knows what it takes to make a reliable 48RE hold up to whatever the end user is doing with their Dodge Cummins pickup. Randy has spent 1,000’s of hours building, designing, and breaking transmissions to gain the knowledge and understanding what it takes to build a 48RE to the level you need. That’s why Randy’s transmissions have more new replacement parts than any other remanufacture in the industry. Browse our Dodge Cummins 48RE transmission line-up by Randy’s Transmission and if you have any question please feel free to contact us and we will gladly help you decide what Randy’s transmission would be best fit for your needs.</p>","<style>.wsm-cat-ship-free-msg {

</p>
<p>
Titan Fuel Tanks was started in 2003 in response to the voices of diesel truck owners who wanted to go farther-- longer. Without fear, they wanted to be able to go where the nearest fuel station might be hundreds of miles away. Anyone who has towed a trailer knows what it does to your mileage know how far it will be until the next station, you will often end up at overpriced stations that know they can gouge you and get away with it.
</p>","    <strong>The Birth of a Titan</strong>
<p>
Our goal was simple; design a lightweight tank that would fit each vehicle perfectly, not impact cargo space and provide up to double a pickup’s fuel range. The tank had to operate without interfering with any functional parts of a vehicle, including the hitch, and – the real kicker – it had to look good. Because the last thing we want is to make your vehicle something you would be less proud of.
</p>
<p>
A chemical engineer introduced us to XLHDPE – Cross-linked High Density Polyethylene -- we knew right away that this was it. It’s superior to the linear polyethylene used in original equipment tanks because the molecules of the polymer weave more tightly together (thus the term ‘cross-linked’).
</p>
<p>
The cross-linked molecular weave makes our fuel tanks stronger, safer, and more durable than most anything on the market. It allows us to confidently back each one with our unparalleled lifetime warranty.
</p>
<p>
With the pieces in place, Titan extra-large-capacity, under-body replacement fuel tanks were born.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why TITAN Tanks Are the Best You Can Buy</strong>
</p>
<p>
The bodies of all TITAN Fuel Tanks are made of one remarkable material: High-Density Cross-Linked Polyethylene (XLHDPE).
</p>
<p>
XLHDPE is one of those space-age materials which performs amazing feats; such as superior performance in any weather and in extreme hot or cold temperatures. With its seamless design, the TITAN Fuel Tank is one piece – and very tough.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Easy Installation</strong>
</p>
<p>
Over the years, we have continually modified our products to make them easier to install and allowing them to hold out longer without needing to be repaired or replaced. Our all-purpose lightweight tanks are so easy to install that a driveway mechanic can do the job himself in just a few hours without needing any serious tools.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Difference Is Molecular Bond</strong>
</p>
<p>
Linear polyethylene (OEM) tanks are the standard in many of today’s vehicle and replacement tanks. The material is durable, flexible and crack resistant. Titan’s “Cross-Linked” tanks are far superior to the standard linear polyethylene models.
</p>
<p>
The term “Cross-Linked” means the molecular “chains” that make up the polymer are chemically bonded together, or “bridged” to form a continuous three-dimensional structure. This allows impact energy to be dissipated throughout the chain of molecules.
</p>
<p>
<strong>TITAN (Cross-Linked) vs. OEM (Linear)</strong>
</p>
<p>
TITAN Fuel Tanks provide...
</p><ul>
	<li>20 times the environmental stress crack resistance</li>
	<li>10 times the molecular weight</li>
	<li>5 times the impact strength</li>
</ul>
...of the OEM (Linear) models.
<p></p>
<p>
<strong>Superior Chemical and Impact Resistance</strong>
</p>
<p>
Compared to commonly used materials such as Linear Polyethylene and many grades of metal tanks, Cross-Linked Polyethylene has the widest range of chemical resistance and superior impact strength. TITAN Tanks won’t corrode, are especially well-suited for bio-diesel applications, and are much less subject to the formation of condensation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>U.S. Department of Defense Standards</strong>
</p>
<p>
On the battlefield, performance is not a luxury, it’s a necessity. That’s why the U.S. Department of Defense uses the very same processes and materials as TITAN for fuel tanks in many of the U.S. Military’s combat vehicles.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ongoing Innovation</strong>
</p>
<p>
Today, we have expanded our product line beyond our under-body replacement tanks to include a growing number of award winning products. Some of these are so innovative they have been recognized as “firsts” in the industry. An example is our unique Spare Tire Auxiliary Fuel System (STAFS) which adds 30 gallons of additional fuel to most any American made diesel pickup without invading the cargo space. We also offer in-bed polymer (XLHDPE) fuel tanks from 15 to 100 gallons.
</p>
<p>
TITAN has hundreds of dealers across the United States. TITAN Diesel Tanks are sold throughout the U.S., Canada, and Australia, wherever American diesel trucks roll.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Titan’s Dream Team</strong>
</p>
<p>
Titan’s extraordinary success is due to a staff that is truly a “dream team” of engineers, technicians, craftsmen, technical service experts, inventory specialists, marketers, customer service professionals and many others. The management team has enjoyed the privilege of leading this team since 2007. Their technical background in design and manufacturing management ensures that Titan’s customers receive the best value for their money.

<p>US Diesel Parts carries a wide range Dodge Ram Cummins 2nd Gen Swap kits from Industrial Injection, BD Diesel and a few others. On the 2nd Gen trucks the turbocharger is mounted on the middle of the exhaust manifold while the 3rd and 4th gen is located at the back. In theory, the exhaust pulse in the central location is much more efficient for turbo spool. This location is much easier to get to and makes future modifications a lot easier. Not only being less restrictive than the stock 3rd and 4th Gen manifold, you will be installing a more reliable NON-VGT turbocharger in place of the stock unit. There are many options to choose from so if you need help on deciding which turbo is good for you, please don’t hesitate to give us a call or email us.</p>","","1209302","https://usdieselparts.com/images/F144555307","","","2ND Gen Swap Kits","500","Dodge>2007.5 - 2018 6.7L Dodge Cummins>Turbochargers - 2007.5-2018 Dodge 6.7L>2ND Gen Swap Kits - Dodge 6.7L","2019-01-11 19:30:34",""

"Fuel System Components - GM Duramax LML","Fleece Performance - In-Tank Fuel Pumps & Sending Units - LML Duramax","If you do not know already, Duramax trucks do not come with any lift pump supplying fuel to the injection pump. This added stress on the fuel system can create poor mileage and low power especially under a loaded situation. The factory CP4 injection pumps are substantially weaker than that of the previous model years CP3. Not having a steady reliable flow of fuel will increase the risk of the CP4 failing. Adding this pump from Fleece will drastically reduce the chance of CP4 failure. Also, any time a tuner is added to these trucks, more fuel is demanded out of the injection pump and if there is no fuel supplying that pump, you are loosing power! Adding a lift pump system to your LML will help improve overall efficiency and mileage. They are however absolutely necessary for anyone that wants to make power on these trucks. Until now, the only options were frame mounted pumps that look out of place on your LML Duramax. No more noisy lift pumps, cutting holes in your fuel tank, or quarter tank issues. Fleece's drop-in lift pump allows for silent operation, utilizes the factory connections for an easy installation and its active fill bucket technology eliminates the need for a draw straw or tank sump. The PowerFlo Lift Pump operates with two OEM quality gerotor pumps that have surpassed 12,000 hours of durability testing and together flow 170 GPH @ 15 psi, making the PowerFlo Lift Pump capable of supporting 800+ RWHP. Fleece also offers performance SureFlo sending units using their baffled fuel bucket to be used with an aftermarket fuel pump.","","1209312","https://usdieselparts.com/images/F144556294","Fleece Performance - In-Tank Fuel Pumps and Sending Units for 2011-2016 GM 6.6L LML Duramax Diesel Trucks","2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, GM, GMC, Sierra, Silverado, HD, 2500, 3500, good, best, fuel, delivery, sump","Fleece Performance - In-Tank Fuel Pumps & Sending Units - LML Duramax","370","Chevy / GMC>2011 - 2016 6.6L Duramax LML>Fuel System Components - GM Duramax LML>Fleece Performance - In-Tank Fuel Pumps & Sending Units - LML Duramax","2019-03-01 19:48:12",""

The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction.

The movement of the fuel inside the tank, and the process of fuel transfer under these conditions creates as much as 10% air/vapor within the fuel. Symptoms of air/vapor can be low horsepower, poor fuel mileage, excessive smoke, injector failure, hard starting, surging and rough running. You can eliminate this problem with a FASS Fuel Air Separation System and get ""test cell"" performance under real world conditions.</p>

<p align=""left"">The feel of a performance clutch can differ greatly from the factory clutch. You can minimize these effects and increase clutch longevity by choosing the right clutch for your truck based on the horsepower and what you use your truck for. A clutch designed to hold 550 hp may not act right in a truck that only puts out 350 hp, so try to choose a clutch that closely matches or only slightly exceeds your trucks horsepower level.</p>

<p>For performance and reliability an updated turbocharger is one of the best upgrades you can do for your diesel.  It can be an easy decision at first to change out your turbocharger for a performance turbo.  This is where most encounter their first wall in doing so.  The diesel performance world has so many options that it quickly becomes very difficult on choosing what turbo is right for you.  You can search the web, ask your buddies, check out forums and by the end of the day, you most likely still will be confused and settle back on buying a stock turbocharger.  Don't do it!  We're not being cliche' when we say ""Let the pro's help"" because we really can help make the best decision for your vehicles turbocharger needs.  At the same time we're also not trying to sell you the biggest and most bad-ass turbo you can afford when a more refined solution will perform better.  Let us explain below.</p>

<p>Many people want to go as big as they can, and we can help if that's what you're looking for, but for the most part we've found the majority may only need a simple stage 1 upgrade to give them that extra pulling power and performance they're looking for.  You can quickly find yourself having to build around a large turbocharger ~ often to get the same performance you could have gotten from a smaller turbo without the problems or extra costs associated with doing so.</p>

<p>We've been installing upgraded turbos for well over two decades and feel we have enough experience to put our customers into a turbocharger that fits their needs. To do this, and help clear up the confusion, we put together a selection of  turbochargers below that are simple, straight forward to install, that may only require a small amount of extra fueling to perform.  These turbos are excellent in quality, have been proven to perform, and are designed to run with your emissions intact. Anytime you upgrade to a larger turbo you will have more turbo lag. Turbo lag is the response time it takes for the turbo to spool up. The more turbo lag you have, the more smoke and less drive-ability you will have. We recommend a tuner to help that turbo spool up quicker so you will have less smoke, lower EGT’s, and make the drive more enjoyable.  If you don’t have a tuner already and need help on choosing the best one that fits your needs or if you want more options on the turbo’s please feel free to call us.</p>","<style>

"Fuel System Components - GM Duramax LMM","Fleece Performance - In-Tank Fuel Pump & Sending Units - GM Duramax LMM","If you do not know already, Duramax trucks do not come with any lift pump supplying fuel to the injection pump. This added stress on the fuel system can create poor mileage and low power especially under a loaded situation. The factory CP4 injection pumps are substantially weaker than that of the previous model years CP3. Not having a steady reliable flow of fuel will increase the risk of the CP4 failing. Adding this pump from Fleece will drastically reduce the chance of CP4 failure. Also, any time a tuner is added to these trucks, more fuel is demanded out of the injection pump and if there is no fuel supplying that pump, you are loosing power! Adding a lift pump system to your LML will help improve overall efficiency and mileage. They are however absolutely necessary for anyone that wants to make power on these trucks. Until now, the only options were frame mounted pumps that look out of place on your LML Duramax. No more noisy lift pumps, cutting holes in your fuel tank, or quarter tank issues. Fleece's drop-in lift pump allows for silent operation, utilizes the factory connections for an easy installation and its active fill bucket technology eliminates the need for a draw straw or tank sump. The PowerFlo Lift Pump operates with two OEM quality gerotor pumps that have surpassed 12,000 hours of durability testing and together flow 170 GPH @ 15 psi, making the PowerFlo Lift Pump capable of supporting 800+ RWHP. Fleece also offers performance SureFlo sending units using their baffled fuel bucket to be used with an aftermarket fuel pump.","","1209441","https://usdieselparts.com/images/F144568750","","","Fleece Performance - In-Tank Fuel Pumps & Sending Units - GM Duramax LMM","350","Chevy / GMC>2007 - 2010 6.6L Duramax LMM>Fuel System Components - GM Duramax LMM>Fleece Performance - In-Tank Fuel Pump & Sending Units - GM Duramax LMM","2020-04-06 16:46:51",""

"Dodge","2019 - 2022 6.7L Dodge Cummins","<p>If you’re looking for Dodge 6.7L Cummins performance parts, you’ve come to the right place. US Diesel Parts is home to the best inventory of diesel truck parts on the market.  </p>
<p align=""left""><b>• 2007 - 2022 Dodge 6.7L Cummins HPCR (High Pressure Common Rail) <br>
  • Generation 3 and 4, Inline 6-cylinder, 4-stroke, 24 Valve<br>
  • 350-385-400 HP, 650-850-100 ft-lbs torque </b></p>

  <p align=""left"">In 2007, Cummins bumped the displacement from 5.9L up to a healthy 6.7L engine. The 2008-2012 6.7L engine cranks out 350 hp and 650 ft-lbs of torque, 2013-2018 puts out 385hp with close to 900 ft-lbs of torque, and the 2019+ running 400+ HP with 1000 ft-lbs of torque! The power is put to a Mercedes G56 6-spd manual transmission, or a Chrysler 6-spd 68RFE automatic transmission. Thanks to changes in the common rail fuel system, the engine runs noticeably quieter. 2007 also marked the year that Dodge introduced the diesel particulate filter (DPF), an Exhaust Gas Recirculation system (EGR) and a Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT) to assist with meeting strict emissions regulations. Unfortunately, sacrifices to power and fuel economy are made in the process of meeting emissions. We can help you recover some MPGs and power from your 6.7L engine with a variety of 6.7L Cummins performance aftermarket products. If you don’t see the 6.7L Cummins performance part that you’re looking for, contact us for assistance.</p>

When this happens, the only recourse is a complete fuel system replacement including fuel lines, filters, injectors, fuel rail and connector tubes.  A huge cost that could have be prevented.  If you decide to keep running the stock CP4, please invest in using a lubricity additive.  Otherwise, a CP3 conversion kit is what we would advise.  The CP3 pump is a tried and true design that, while not failure proof, have shown they are a work-horse since the late 90's.

"Fuel System Components - GM 6.5L TD","FASS® Products - GM 6.5L TD","<p align=""left"">Air/vapor in diesel fuel is a common problem with any diesel vehicle where the fuel tank is located at a lower point than the engine. The movement of the fuel inside the tank, and the process of fuel transfer under these conditions creates as much as 10% air/vapor within the fuel. Symptoms of air/vapor can be low horsepower, poor fuel mileage, excessive smoke, injector failure, hard starting, surging and rough running. You can eliminate this problem with a FASS Fuel Air Separation System and get &quot;test cell&quot; performance under real world conditions.</p>

<p>The towing capabilities of pickup trucks has steadily risen over the last 30 years. New trucks are capable of towing 30,000+ pounds. This consistent increase in towing capability pushed the need for us to create a trailer hitch that could match and/or exceed the tow rating of new trucks in addition to providing the versatility necessary to tow multiple trailers at different ride heights. Our solution to this ongoing issue was to create the ultimate trailer hitch to surpass anything the industry had seen before.</p>
