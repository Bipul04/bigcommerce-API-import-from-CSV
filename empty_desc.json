There were few changes made to the engine in the 1994 5.9L Cummins, but there were significant developments made to the fuel system. Most notable being the introduction of the durable Bosch P7100 injection pump. The massive P7100 inline injection pump allowed for more precise control over fuel delivery, and those wanting huge power gains love the P7100 pump because modifications are simple, inexpensive and impressive. Six different fuel stop plates are available that will enable power gains from 30-150 hp and 70-300 ft-lbs of torque. Our parts inventory includes a wide variety of 12V Cummins performance parts. We can recalibrate your P7100 to make further improvements to the fuel delivery and governor settings as well. We also have performance injectors to give it that extra kick. Exhaust and intake improvements will help your 5.9L breathe easier, provide lower EGTs, increase fuel economy, and boost performance. We also have factory replacement and performance turbochargers that can handle the huge horsepower increases that the Gen II engine is capable of delivering.

Cummins answered \r\n  that call in late 1998 with the Gen II, 24-Valve 5.9L ISB (Intellect System \r\n  B) engine in the Dodge Ram. The electronically controlled Bosch VP44 injection \r\n  pump was a state of the art fuel delivery system that pushed the 5.9L 24-Valve \r\n  engine to 215-235 hp. Problems with the weak factory fuel supply pump are common \r\n  and can destroy the VP44 injection pump. Fortunately, we can help you solve \r\n  this issue with a FASS or Airdog fuel pump. A High Output (HO) 245 HP version \r\n  was released in 2001, and the 2002 HO model was capable of producing an impressive \r\n  305 hp from the factory. Electronic tuning opened up a whole new world for performance \r\n  enthusiasts. A variety of electronic tuners are available that can easily coax \r\n  an additional 100 hp out of your 5.9L ISB engine. An added benefit to electronic \r\n  performance tuning is that increases in fuel economy can also be enjoyed. Throw \r\n  in a cold-air intake kit, a performance exhaust system, and you've got yourself \r\n  a real beast that is getting better fuel economy than it did when it left the \r\n  dealership. Factory replacement or performance turbochargers are also available. \r\n</p>\r\n"

By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>\r\n"

    "description": "<p align=\"left\">The Bosch Dodge VP44 diesel injection pump for 1998.5 - 2002 Dodge \r\n  5.9L Cummins 24V is a workhorse of a pump, but they are prone to a few problems. \r\n  If you are experiencing intermittent hard starting and white smoke, then there \r\n  may be an electrical problem with the Electronic Diesel Control unit (EDC) module \r\n  on top of the pump which is caused by heat and vibration. The EDC cannot be \r\n  replaced, so an EDC failure will require pump replacement. Also, severe internal \r\n  pump damage can occur if fuel supply pressure drops to 5psi or lower, especially \r\n  under heavy loads or high rpm's. When this happens, you may notice low power \r\n  or it may seem like the engine won't rev up the way it should. Eventually the \r\n  diaphragm in the front of the VP44 will rupture. This results excessive vibration \r\n  of the timing piston which then causes damage to the front cover of the injection \r\n  pump. (DTC #P0216) Also, the head &amp; rotor in the pump may seize resulting \r\n  in a &quot;no start&quot; condition. Dodge acknowledged this issue by replacing \r\n  the supply pump on the the engine with a tank mounted supply pump. This is a \r\n  costly replacement for below average results, especially if you have made any \r\n  performance modifications such as a tuner or hi-performance injectors. The best \r\n  way to deal with this problem is by replacing the factory fuel supply pump with \r\n  an AirDog or FASS supply pump such as a FASS DDRP for stock engines, or a FASS \r\n  Titanium for modified engines. A FASS system will supply constant pressure under \r\n  any load to the injection pump, virtually eliminating VP44 damage due to low \r\n  fuel pressure.</p>\r\n"

Cummins introduced the 325 \r\n  hp &quot;600&quot; series engine midway through 2004 (identifiable by a red \r\n  or silver tag on the drivers side of the engine that shows the torque rating \r\n  at &quot;600&quot;). The &quot;610&quot; model was released in 2005, and was \r\n  capable of an impressive 325 hp and 610 lb-ft of torque. The 5.9L Cummins 610 \r\n  remained unchanged through 2006 and the early 2007 5.9L models. These were the \r\n  first Cummins 5.9L 24-Valve engine to feature the Bosch Common Rail injection \r\n  system which gets it's steady supply of fuel from a CP3 high pressure supply \r\n  pump. This new technology doesn't come at a cheap price, and that's why we always \r\n  recommend a FASS system to protect your investment. A variety of electronic \r\n  tuners are available that can easily squeeze an additional 100 hp out of your \r\n  5.9L engine. An added benefit to electronic performance tuning is that increases \r\n  in fuel economy can also be enjoyed. Throw in a cold-air intake kit, a performance \r\n  exhaust system, and you've got yourself a real beast that is getting better \r\n  fuel economy than it did when it left the dealership.

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

The '08-'12 6.7L engine cranks out 350 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque, and 2013-up puts out 385hp right off the showroom floor. The power is put to a Mercedes G56 6-spd manual transmission, or a Chrysler 6-spd 68RFE automatic transmission. Thanks to changes in the common rail fuel system, the engine runs noticeably quieter. 2007 also marked the year that Dodge introduced the diesel particulate filter (DPF), an Exhaust Gas Recirculation system (EGR) and a Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT) to assist with meeting strict emissions regulations. Unfortunately, sacrifices to power and fuel economy are made in the process of meeting emissions. We can help you recover some MPGs and power from your 6.7L engine with a variety of 6.7L Cummins performance aftermarket products.

    "description": "Intercoolers and related parts for 1994 - 1998 Dodge 5.9L Cummins 12V.  Heat is one of the biggest threats to overall powertrain longevity. As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>"

    "description": "<p>The 2003-2007 Dodge Cummins 5.9L turbo diesel automatic pickups came equipped with a 48RE transmission. The 48RE transmissions were really designed for about 570 lb-ft of torque from the factory. Meanwhile, the standard Cummins in this year range has peaked at 610 lb-ft from the factory. The limits of the 48RE transmission are quickly understood especially when performance modifications have been added to the vehicle.  Randy’s Transmissions understand the limits of the 48RE and really knows what it takes to make a reliable 48RE hold up to whatever the end user is doing with their Dodge Cummins pickup. Randy has spent 1,000’s of hours building, designing, and breaking transmissions to gain the knowledge and understanding what it takes to build a 48RE to the level you need. That’s why Randy’s transmissions have more new replacement parts than any other remanufacture in the industry. Browse our Dodge Cummins 48RE transmission line-up by Randy’s Transmission and if you have any question please feel free to contact us and we will gladly help you decide what Randy’s transmission would be best fit for your needs.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Over the last twenty years there was an huge increase in companies dealing with rebuilt or remanufactured diesel engines. Even with the legendary longevity the diesel typically provides, these motors can and do wear out - requiring replacement. US Diesel Parts has dealt with quite a few of these companies, in our shop and online, getting diesel owners back on the road with a reman diesel. We've seen many of these companies come on strong and then disappear when their product fails. This has not been the case with Reviva. They've been around for over 70 years in the diesel market and we've found their engines to be well above the standard for quality and reliability. They stand behind their product with a fair warranty too. In our experience, while you may be able to find a rebuilt engine for cheaper, you'll be much happier with one from Reviva.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of our Reviva Dodge 6.7L Cummins Drop-In engines are 100% dyno tested prior to shipment. Computer controls ensure that each engine dyno test is conducted under standard, repeatable settings.  The Drop –In engine comes with everything the Cummins 6.7L engine needs to run.  Our Reviva Cummins 6.7L long block engines lead the industry in value and in quality. You just get more when you buy our Dodge 6.7L Cummins long block!  </p>\r\n"

On the 2nd Gen trucks the turbocharger is mounted on the middle of the exhaust manifold while the 3rd and 4th gen is located at the back. In theory, the exhaust pulse in the central location is much more efficient for turbo spool. This location is much easier to get to and makes future modifications a lot easier. Not only being less restrictive than the stock 3rd and 4th Gen manifold, you will be installing a more reliable NON-VGT turbocharger in place of the stock unit. There are many options to choose from so if you need help on deciding which turbo is good for you, please don’t hesitate to give us a call or email us.</p>"
