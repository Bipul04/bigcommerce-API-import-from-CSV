    "description": "<b>Stanadyne Mechanical DB2 injection pumps for 1982 - 1994 Chevy GMC 6.2L & 6.5L Diesel Trucks</b><br/>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Our factory trained and certified technicians have been rebuilding DB2 injection pumps since they were introduced by Stanadyne, so we know them inside and out. Each pump is completely disassembled, thoroughly inspected and all worn parts replaced with genuine OEM Stanadyne components. The pump is then cleaned, reassembled and precisely calibrated to factory specifications. One weak point on Stanadyne DB2 pumps that is often ignored by most rebuilders is the advance bore. The aluminum housing tends to wear out quickly where the steel advance piston is located, causing poor pump timing, poor fuel mileage, excess smoke and low power. We address this problem by utilizing a steel sleeve in the advance bore. This gives us a more precise pump calibration and a superior injection pump that will last considerably longer.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">All DB2 injection pumps include a 1-year warranty.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"><b><font color=\"red\">NOTE:</font></b> The pumps we have listed for sale here will cover most GM 6.2L and 6.5L trucks with the Stanadyne DB2 pump.

The Stanadyne DS4 electronic diesel fuel injection pump has marked its place in diesel history. We rebuilt hundreds of them under the GM warranty service period before they finally got all the bugs worked out. Some of them passed through our doors 2-3 times or more before the customer could actually get their truck out of the driveway. GM and Stanadyne took a huge gamble when they neglected to do some proper testing on their new system, but the good news is that the DS4 injection pump is actually a pretty solid and reliable unit now. The PMD is still an issue, but we've even got the answers to all of your PMD problems that will eliminate your hot hard starting and intermittent stalling issues. We also have some great performance upgrades for the electronics, exhaust system, intake and turbocharger that will help you get some better fuel economy and some really decent horsepower gains.

    "description": "We have saved our customers hundreds of thousands of dollars in unnecessary repairs over the years with the following information:\r\n<br>\r\nIf your 6.5L diesel (with the DS4 electronic injection pump) is showing symptoms of stalling, hard starting, and hesitation, then you don't necessarily need to replace the injection pump as most shops and dealerships will try to tell you. The PMD (Pump Mounted Driver) is prone to failure from constant heating and cooling when mounted inside the engine compartment and needs to be moved out in order to assure maximum performance and long service life. Our 6.5L PMD Cooler Kit conveniently mounts your new pump mounted driver (PMD) on the intake manifold. This is a very nice, tidy installation and provides much cooler and more consistent temperatures that will keep the PMD from failing. Also, when using our relocation kit, there is no need to remove the intake manifold from the engine because the old PMD can simply stay mounted to the injection pump."

They experienced\r\nsome injector issues early on, but quickly addressed the problems.\r\nThe mighty 6.6L Duramax pumped out a respectable 300HP right off the showroom\r\nfloor. The absence of restrictive emissions on the LB7 allowed owners to get\r\nmore miles between fill ups than most people thought possible from a 3/4 ton\r\npickup. Most modern diesel engines have great potential for power and economy\r\ngains over the factory set up, and the LB7 is no exception. We always like\r\nto suggest a cold air intake kit and a free flowing exhaust system to lower\r\nEGT's and increase MPG's and power. A good tuner will help you pull those steep\r\nhills with ease and also get you some great power and economy gains.

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

In 2006, the LLY featured some more extensive mechanical changes such as connecting rods, heads and injectors, but the initial LLY was basically the same engine as it's predecessor. A few things you may notice on the LLY when you pop the hood open is the introduction of some mandatory emissions equipment such as an EGR system and a variable geometry turbocharger (VGT). Ironically, better emissions didn't help the LLY's fuel economy. But fortunately, we can help you reclaim some of that with an intake kit, exhaust system or tuner.

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

As with previous models, GM made few changes to the engine which proves once again that the Duramax is a solid engine and GM didn't see the need to make any major changes to the sturdy 360HP beast. But there were a few mandatory changes to the emissions system, most noticeably being the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) located underneath the truck. The job of the DPF is to filter the used particulates from the exhaust before they reach the air. It works very well too.

    "description": "\r\n<div class=\"QuickTitle\">AirDog Fuel Air Separation Systems for 2007 - 2010 Chevy GMC 6.6L Duramax LMM</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The AirDog Fuel Air Separation System removes air, vapor and particulates from diesel fuel so only pure diesel fuel reaches your engine.  This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><style>.wsm-cat-cat-image {display:none;}</style>\r\n<p align=\"left\">The Duramax is probably the most responsive to an aftermarket \r\n  lift pump. The GMC and Chevy Duramax pick-up trucks do NOT have a lift pump \r\n  to supply fuel to the engine. From the factory, the CP3 injection pump is the \r\n  truck's only means of getting fuel from the tank to the engine. If you were \r\n  to look at our video of How the AirDog works it will show you what happens \r\n  when the CP3 pump pulls fuel from the tank to the engine. Therefore because \r\n  the fuel is under constant suction it causes cavitation and excessive wear and \r\n  tear on injectors and your injection pump. Also, this is the #1 cause of low \r\n  rail pressure codes when adding aftermarket programmers or tuners that increase \r\n  the demand for fuel. By providing both constant positive fuel pressure and 100% \r\n  pure fuel to the engine, is where you get the added benefits of smoother and \r\n  quieter idle, better throttle response, increased fuel economy, better mid-range \r\n  through top end power and more consistent rail pressure to support both stock \r\n  and modified engines.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"> Because we have a few different systems for the Duramax, install \r\n  difficulty and times will vary. For example; The AirDog II, FP100 and Raptor \r\n  pump kits do not require you to drop the tank to install the system. Because \r\n  of our OEM style quick connect fittings and internal pump design on the AirDog \r\n  II, you will simply hook the suction line to the factory fitting on the fuel \r\n  tank sending unit. However, if you're going to install an AirDog FP150, this \r\n  will require dropping the tank to install a 1/2&quot; suction tube. None of \r\n  the Raptor kits require a suction tube to be installed. </p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">As for the rest of the install, for fuel supply, all of the systems \r\n  will either hook to the factory steel feed line that runs up to the engine or \r\n  the line directly on the engine, we give the choice of hooking to either spot \r\n  based on your mechanical capabilities. On the AirDog and AirDog II systems, \r\n  the entrained air and un-used fuel will be sent from the system back to the \r\n  tank through the fuel filler tube. Also, the factory fuel filter housing will \r\n  remain in use when using any of the AirDog or Raptor fuel systems. </p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Many people ask why the AirDog II, with its higher flow rate doesn't \r\n  need the 1/2&quot; suction tube. The reason for that is the way the AirDog II \r\n  is designed internally. The AirDog II recycles fuel back through the base to \r\n  keep the system constantly full, therefore returning less and making it a true \r\n  ON Demand system. Also, all of the AirDog and AirDog II systems have a built \r\n  in pressure port on the top of the base directly above the fuel filter, it's \r\n  plugged with an 1/8&quot; pipe plug and can be removed and utilized to check \r\n  pressure from. </p>"

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

Most notable being the introduction of the durable Bosch P7100 injection pump. The massive P7100 inline injection pump allowed for more precise control over fuel delivery, and those wanting huge power gains love the P7100 pump because modifications are simple, inexpensive and impressive. Six different fuel stop plates are available that will enable power gains from 30-150 hp and 70-300 ft-lbs of torque. Our parts inventory includes a wide variety of 12V Cummins performance parts.

Cummins answered \r\n  that call in late 1998 with the Gen II, 24-Valve 5.9L ISB (Intellect System \r\n  B) engine in the Dodge Ram. The electronically controlled Bosch VP44 injection \r\n  pump was a state of the art fuel delivery system that pushed the 5.9L 24-Valve \r\n  engine to 215-235 hp. Problems with the weak factory fuel supply pump are common \r\n  and can destroy the VP44 injection pump. Fortunately, we can help you solve \r\n  this issue with a FASS or Airdog fuel pump. A High Output (HO) 245 HP version \r\n  was released in 2001, and the 2002 HO model was capable of producing an impressive \r\n  305 hp from the factory. Electronic tuning opened up a whole new world for performance \r\n  enthusiasts. A variety of electronic tuners are available that can easily coax \r\n  an additional 100 hp out of your 5.9L ISB engine. An added benefit to electronic \r\n  performance tuning is that increases in fuel economy can also be enjoyed. Throw \r\n  in a cold-air intake kit, a performance exhaust system, and you've got yourself \r\n  a real beast that is getting better fuel economy than it did when it left the \r\n  dealership. Factory replacement or performance turbochargers are also available. \r\n</p>\r\n<br><div align=\"left\">1998.5 Dodge 5.9L Cummins 24V, Gen II, VP44 Injection Pump - \r\n  235hp, 460 lbs-ft torque<br>\r\n  1999 Dodge 5.9L Cummins 24V, Gen II, VP44 Injection Pump - 235hp, 460 lbs-ft \r\n  torque<br>\r\n  2000 Dodge 5.9L Cummins 24V, Gen II, VP44 Injection Pump - 235hp, 460 lbs-ft \r\n  torque<br>\r\n  2001 Dodge 5.9L Cummins 24V, Gen II, VP44 Injection Pump - 245hp, 505 lbs-ft \r\n  torque<br>\r\n  2002 Dodge 5.9L Cummins 24V, Gen II, VP44 Injection Pump - 245hp, 505 lbs-ft \r\n  torque</div>\r\n"

This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>\r\n"

    "description": "<p align=\"left\">The Bosch Dodge VP44 diesel injection pump for 1998.5 - 2002 Dodge \r\n  5.9L Cummins 24V is a workhorse of a pump, but they are prone to a few problems. \r\n  If you are experiencing intermittent hard starting and white smoke, then there \r\n  may be an electrical problem with the Electronic Diesel Control unit (EDC) module \r\n  on top of the pump which is caused by heat and vibration. The EDC cannot be \r\n  replaced, so an EDC failure will require pump replacement. Also, severe internal \r\n  pump damage can occur if fuel supply pressure drops to 5psi or lower, especially \r\n  under heavy loads or high rpm's. When this happens, you may notice low power \r\n  or it may seem like the engine won't rev up the way it should. Eventually the \r\n  diaphragm in the front of the VP44 will rupture. This results excessive vibration \r\n  of the timing piston which then causes damage to the front cover of the injection \r\n  pump. (DTC #P0216) Also, the head &amp; rotor in the pump may seize resulting \r\n  in a &quot;no start&quot; condition. Dodge acknowledged this issue by replacing \r\n  the supply pump on the the engine with a tank mounted supply pump. This is a \r\n  costly replacement for below average results, especially if you have made any \r\n  performance modifications such as a tuner or hi-performance injectors. The best \r\n  way to deal with this problem is by replacing the factory fuel supply pump with \r\n  an AirDog or FASS supply pump such as a FASS DDRP for stock engines, or a FASS \r\n  Titanium for modified engines. A FASS system will supply constant pressure under \r\n  any load to the injection pump, virtually eliminating VP44 damage due to low \r\n  fuel pressure.</p>\r\n"

Cummins introduced the 325 \r\n  hp &quot;600&quot; series engine midway through 2004 (identifiable by a red \r\n  or silver tag on the drivers side of the engine that shows the torque rating \r\n  at &quot;600&quot;). The &quot;610&quot; model was released in 2005, and was \r\n  capable of an impressive 325 hp and 610 lb-ft of torque. The 5.9L Cummins 610 \r\n  remained unchanged through 2006 and the early 2007 5.9L models. These were the \r\n  first Cummins 5.9L 24-Valve engine to feature the Bosch Common Rail injection \r\n  system which gets it's steady supply of fuel from a CP3 high pressure supply \r\n  pump. This new technology doesn't come at a cheap price, and that's why we always \r\n  recommend a FASS system to protect your investment. A variety of electronic \r\n  tuners are available that can easily squeeze an additional 100 hp out of your \r\n  5.9L engine. An added benefit to electronic performance tuning is that increases \r\n  in fuel economy can also be enjoyed. Throw in a cold-air intake kit, a performance \r\n  exhaust system, and you've got yourself a real beast that is getting better \r\n  fuel economy than it did when it left the dealership. Factory replacement or \r\n  performance turbochargers are also available</div><br><div align=\"left\"> \r\n  <p>2003 Dodge 5.9L Cummins HPCR 24V, Gen III - 305hp, 555 lbs-ft torque<br>\r\n    2004 Dodge 5.9L Cummins HPCR 24V, Gen III - 325hp, 600 lbs-ft torque<br>\r\n    2005 Dodge 5.9L Cummins HPCR 24V, Gen III - 325hp, 610 lbs-ft torque<br>\r\n    2006 Dodge 5.9L Cummins HPCR 24V, Gen III - 325hp, 610 lbs-ft torque<br>\r\n    2007 Dodge 5.9L Cummins HPCR 24V, Gen III - 350hp, 650 lbs-ft torque</p>\r\n  </div>"

This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>\r\n"

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

The '08-'12 6.7L engine cranks out 350 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque, and 2013-up puts out 385hp right off the showroom floor. The power is put to a Mercedes G56 6-spd manual transmission, or a Chrysler 6-spd 68RFE automatic transmission. Thanks to changes in the common rail fuel system, the engine runs noticeably quieter. 2007 also marked the year that Dodge introduced the diesel particulate filter (DPF), an Exhaust Gas Recirculation system (EGR) and a Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT) to assist with meeting strict emissions regulations.

    "description": "We carry Ford Power Stroke parts for a variety of Ford models dating back to 1983. Ford entered into the light truck diesel market in the early 80's with their Navistar 6.9L and 7.3L IDI naturally aspirated V8 engines which were a huge success for Ford. In 1994 they released the 210 hp Navistar 7.3L Power Stroke engine. Navistar utilized an advanced Hydraulically Activated, Electronically Controlled Unit Injector, or \"HEUI\" for short. Although this unique fuel system seemed years ahead of its time, it had already been proven in the heavy truck market by the time Ford got their hands on it. In 1999, the 7.3L received an intercooler and changes were made to the turbo and injectors. In 2001, we saw power increase to 250-275 hp. The first major modifications to the Ford Power Stroke were made in 2003 with the arrival of the 325 hp 6.0L Power Stroke, and the 7.3L was officially discontinued in 2004. A Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT), Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) and Overhead Valves (OHV) were utilized on the new 6.0L to keep up with emissions demands. 2008 saw the arrival of the 350 hp 6.4L Twin-Turbo Common Rail engine. Advanced emissions make it one of the cleanest running diesel engines ever produced, but owners still report poor fuel mileage. We offer Power Stroke diesel parts that can improve your vehicle’s performance. In 2011 Ford introduced the 6.7L \"Scorpion\" which is the first Power Stroke engine to utilize the Bosch Common Rail injection system. Check out our inventory of Ford Power Stroke parts today to see if we have what you’re looking for.<br><p><b>Power Stroke</b> is a line of diesel engines found in Ford Diesel trucks, Ford Excursion SUVs, Ford Econoline vans, Ford LCF commercial vehicles and the Brazilian Ford Ranger. The V8 engines were produced by Navistar International Corp. until 2010 when Ford decided to build their diesel engine completely in-house. The Power Stroke engines compete primarily in the United States full-size pickup truck market with the Duramax V8 from General Motors/Isuzu and the B series straight 6 from Cummins.</p>"

    "description": "<p style=\"text-align: left\">Ford introduced the first 6.9L diesel engine for their light duty trucks in 1983. The naturally aspirated, indirect injection (IDI) engine featured a Stanadyne DB2 injection pump, and put out a very respectable 170 horsepower for the day. The 6.9L was bored out to 7.3L in 1987. The original 7.3L diesel was a non-turbo charged IDI engine. It was followed shortly after by a turbocharged version, but otherwise remained basically the same throughout 1993. We have been working with these engines since their introduction and can help you with everything from glow plugs to a complete re-manufactured engine. If you're looking for a replacement injection pump or injectors, then you have come to the right place. There are very few performance modifications available for the 6.9L and 7.3L IDI engines.

    "description": "<p align=\"left\">In 1994, the 7.3L was changed to a direct injection (DI) engine and an electronic fuel injection system was added, and the 7.3L Power Stroke was officially underway. The first 7.3L Power Stroke produced 250 hp and 525 lb-ft of torque. The heart of the new design was a &quot;single shot&quot; HEUI (hydraulic electronic unit injector) fuel injection system that ran a 15&deg; high pressure oil pump (HPOP) to create fuel injection pressures. The 1994 - 1997 7.3L Power Strokes are still hugely popular and there is an abundance of aftermarket performance options to choose from. Cold air intake kits and performance exhaust systems will get you a few extra ponies while lowering EGT's and increasing fuel economy. A performance tuner can offer some serious hp gains and also help increase your fuel mileage. Factory and hi-performance turbochargers are also available. We also have everything from high pressure oil pumps, glow plugs and filters to keep your Power Stroke on the road.

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

There were a few notable changes made to the 7.3L Power Stroke in 1999. An intercooler was added to cool the charged air from the turbocharger. The cooler, denser air helps increase horsepower and reduce EGTs. The turbine housing was changed to a .84 A/R and a wastegate was also added. The single shot HEUI injectors were changed to split shot design, and the high-pressure oil pump was advanced to 17° to help increase the necessary fuel pressure. The 1998 7.3L PS was rated at 225 hp, and the 1999 - 2000 models were rated at 235 hp. 2001 - 2003 saw another boost to about 250-275 hp from the factory. We carry an abundance of aftermarket performance options to choose from for the 1998-2003 7.3L Power Strokes. Cold air intake kits and performance exhaust systems will get you a few extra ponies while lowering EGT's and increasing fuel economy. A performance tuner can offer some serious hp gains and also help increase your fuel mileage. Factory and hi-performance turbochargers are also available. Our inventory of stock and performance parts for 7.3L Power Stroke engines includes high-pressure oil pumps, glow plugs, filters, engine kits, fuel injectors, turbochargers, complete engines and more to keep your Power Stroke on the road.

This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>\r\n"

    "description": "Intercoolers and related parts for 1998 - 2003 Ford 7.3L Power Stroke diesel trucks.  Heat is one of the biggest threats to overall powertrain longevity. As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>\r\n"

The engine oil cooler has small narrow, flat cooling tubes that are\r\neasily clogged by foreign material in the coolant. Engine coolant flows through\r\nthe engine oil cooler first and then to the EGR cooler. So if the engine oil\r\ncooler becomes clogged, then engine oil may become overheated causing poor performance\r\nand eventually engine damage. The restricted downstream flow of coolant will\r\nalso cause coolant within the EGR cooler to flash-boil and spill coolant into\r\nthe overflow tank. Eventually the overflow tank overfills, coolant is lost and\r\nthe engine will overheat. In time, the <a href=\"index.cfm/category/833/egr-cooler-delete-kits-60l-power-stroke.cfm\">EGR\r\nCooler</a> can also become corroded under these conditions, and will leak coolant\r\ninto the engine oil.</p>"

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

    "description": "<p align=\"left\"><br>The\r\n6.4L Power Stroke was released in 2008 and produced an impressive 350 hp from\r\nthe factory. The design changes to the 6.4L were made primarily to meet new\r\nemissions requirements. The 6.4L Power Stroke is a clean and quiet running engine\r\nand the first in it's class to feature factory twin turbochargers to help reduce\r\nturbo lag. The 6.4L is also the first Power Stroke engine that utilizes a Common\r\nRail injection system and a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) regenerative system\r\nthat burns off excess soot and ash. While the DPF does a good job of filtering\r\nout particulates, it has had a negative affect on fuel mileage. Fortunately,\r\nthere is an abundance of aftermarket performance options to choose from for\r\nthe 6.4L Power Strokes that will also help increase power and mileage. Cold\r\nair intake kits and performance exhaust systems will get you a few extra ponies\r\nwhile lowering EGT's and increasing fuel mileage. A performance tuner can offer\r\nsome serious hp gains and also help increase your mpg's.</p><br><p>The 6.4 liter also has a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and dual EGR coolers which are capable of reducing exhaust gas temps by up to 1000 degrees before they reach the EGR valve and mix with the intake charge. The Diesel Particulate Filter traps soot and particulates from the exhaust and virtually eliminates the black smoke that most diesel engines expel upon acceleration. The engine computer is programmed to periodically inject extra fuel in the exhaust stroke of the engine (known as a \"regeneration\" in F-Series) to burn off soot that accumulates in the DPF. This engine must run on Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) fuel which has no more than 15 ppm sulfur content; using regular diesel fuel will result in emission equipment malfunctions and violate manufacturer warranties.</p>"

This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>\r\n"

    "description": "<h3>Volkswagen TDI Diesel High Performance Parts and Accessories</h3>\r\n<p>The Volkswagen TDI diesel engine was introduced by VAG in 1989 and was instantly recognized as an economical, yet powerful diesel engine for a mid-sized passenger car. The design featured a Turbocharger and Direct Injection fuel system by Bosch. The advanced turbocharger system increases airflow, and an intercooler lowers the intake air temperatures of the compressed air from the turbo, allowing for greater engine fuel efficiency, more power and torque and lower emissions. </p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">In 2009, a Volkswagen Passat set a fuel economy record by averaging 67.9 miles per gallon in a tour of the 48 contiguous states. More recently, a 2012 Volkswagen Passat TDI SE was driven 1,626.1 miles from Houston, TX to Sterling, Va., breaking the Guinness record for the longest drive in a passenger car on a single tank of diesel fuel. The TDI 1.9L is no slouch either. TDI owners regularly achieve up to 220+ hp to the wheels while still averaging 50 mpg's on the highway. </p>"

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p><br>\r\n<p align=\"left\">The Duramax is probably the most responsive to an aftermarket \r\n  lift pump. The GMC and Chevy Duramax pick-up trucks do NOT have a lift pump \r\n  to supply fuel to the engine. From the factory, the CP3 injection pump is the \r\n  truck's only means of getting fuel from the tank to the engine. If you were \r\n  to look at our video of How the AirDog works it will show you what happens \r\n  when the CP3 pump pulls fuel from the tank to the engine. Therefore because \r\n  the fuel is under constant suction it causes cavitation and excessive wear and \r\n  tear on injectors and your injection pump. Also, this is the #1 cause of low \r\n  rail pressure codes when adding aftermarket programmers or tuners that increase \r\n  the demand for fuel. By providing both constant positive fuel pressure and 100% \r\n  pure fuel to the engine, is where you get the added benefits of smoother and \r\n  quieter idle, better throttle response, increased fuel economy, better mid-range \r\n  through top end power and more consistent rail pressure to support both stock \r\n  and modified engines.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"> Because we have a few different systems for the Duramax, install \r\n  difficulty and times will vary. For example; The AirDog II, FP100 and Raptor \r\n  pump kits do not require you to drop the tank to install the system. Because \r\n  of our OEM style quick connect fittings and internal pump design on the AirDog \r\n  II, you will simply hook the suction line to the factory fitting on the fuel \r\n  tank sending unit. However, if you're going to install an AirDog FP150, this \r\n  will require dropping the tank to install a 1/2&quot; suction tube. None of \r\n  the Raptor kits require a suction tube to be installed. </p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">As for the rest of the install, for fuel supply, all of the systems \r\n  will either hook to the factory steel feed line that runs up to the engine or \r\n  the line directly on the engine, we give the choice of hooking to either spot \r\n  based on your mechanical capabilities. On the AirDog and AirDog II systems, \r\n  the entrained air and un-used fuel will be sent from the system back to the \r\n  tank through the fuel filler tube. Also, the factory fuel filter housing will \r\n  remain in use when using any of the AirDog or Raptor fuel systems. </p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Many people ask why the AirDog II, with its higher flow rate doesn't \r\n  need the 1/2&quot; suction tube. The reason for that is the way the AirDog II \r\n  is designed internally. The AirDog II recycles fuel back through the base to \r\n  keep the system constantly full, therefore returning less and making it a true \r\n  ON Demand system. Also, all of the AirDog and AirDog II systems have a built \r\n  in pressure port on the top of the base directly above the fuel filter, it's \r\n  plugged with an 1/8&quot; pipe plug and can be removed and utilized to check \r\n  pressure from. </p>"

If you were \r\n  to look at our video of How the AirDog works it will show you what happens \r\n  when the CP3 pump pulls fuel from the tank to the engine. Therefore because \r\n  the fuel is under constant suction it causes cavitation and excessive wear and \r\n  tear on injectors and your injection pump. Also, this is the #1 cause of low \r\n  rail pressure codes when adding aftermarket programmers or tuners that increase \r\n  the demand for fuel. By providing both constant positive fuel pressure and 100% \r\n  pure fuel to the engine, is where you get the added benefits of smoother and \r\n  quieter idle, better throttle response, increased fuel economy, better mid-range \r\n  through top end power and more consistent rail pressure to support both stock \r\n  and modified engines.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"> Because we have a few different systems for the Duramax, install \r\n  difficulty and times will vary. For example; The AirDog II, FP100 and Raptor \r\n  pump kits do not require you to drop the tank to install the system. Because \r\n  of our OEM style quick connect fittings and internal pump design on the AirDog \r\n  II, you will simply hook the suction line to the factory fitting on the fuel \r\n  tank sending unit. However, if you're going to install an AirDog FP150, this \r\n  will require dropping the tank to install a 1/2&quot; suction tube. None of \r\n  the Raptor kits require a suction tube to be installed. </p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">As for the rest of the install, for fuel supply, all of the systems \r\n  will either hook to the factory steel feed line that runs up to the engine or \r\n  the line directly on the engine, we give the choice of hooking to either spot \r\n  based on your mechanical capabilities. On the AirDog and AirDog II systems, \r\n  the entrained air and un-used fuel will be sent from the system back to the \r\n  tank through the fuel filler tube. Also, the factory fuel filter housing will \r\n  remain in use when using any of the AirDog or Raptor fuel systems. </p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Many people ask why the AirDog II, with its higher flow rate doesn't \r\n  need the 1/2&quot; suction tube. The reason for that is the way the AirDog II \r\n  is designed internally. The AirDog II recycles fuel back through the base to \r\n  keep the system constantly full, therefore returning less and making it a true \r\n  ON Demand system. Also, all of the AirDog and AirDog II systems have a built \r\n  in pressure port on the top of the base directly above the fuel filter, it's \r\n  plugged with an 1/8&quot; pipe plug and can be removed and utilized to check \r\n  pressure from. </p>"

    "description": "Intercoolers for 2006 - 2007 Chevy GMC Duramax 6.6L LBZ.  Heat is one of the biggest threats to overall powertrain longevity. As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

    "description": "\r\n<div class=\"QuickTitle\">AirDog Fuel Air Separation Systems for 2006 - 2007 Chevy GMC 6.6L Duramax LBZ</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The AirDog Fuel Air Separation System removes air, vapor and particulates from diesel fuel so only pure diesel fuel reaches your engine.  This not only means a longer life for your injectors and injection pump but also optimizes your engines performance in the following ways.  By removing the air and vapor, the fuel is more dense when it reaches the cylinder.  This is what really increases your torque output and throttle response.  Better torque means having to use less fuel to accomplish the same amount of work.  In short; better horsepower, better fuel economy, better fuel system wear.  A true win-win-win situation.</p>\r\n<br><style>.wsm-cat-cat-image {display:none;}</style>\r\n<p align=\"left\">The Duramax is probably the most responsive to an aftermarket \r\n  lift pump. The GMC and Chevy Duramax pick-up trucks do NOT have a lift pump \r\n  to supply fuel to the engine. From the factory, the CP3 injection pump is the \r\n  truck's only means of getting fuel from the tank to the engine. If you were \r\n  to look at our video of How the AirDog works it will show you what happens \r\n  when the CP3 pump pulls fuel from the tank to the engine. Therefore because \r\n  the fuel is under constant suction it causes cavitation and excessive wear and \r\n  tear on injectors and your injection pump. Also, this is the #1 cause of low \r\n  rail pressure codes when adding aftermarket programmers or tuners that increase \r\n  the demand for fuel. By providing both constant positive fuel pressure and 100% \r\n  pure fuel to the engine, is where you get the added benefits of smoother and \r\n  quieter idle, better throttle response, increased fuel economy, better mid-range \r\n  through top end power and more consistent rail pressure to support both stock \r\n  and modified engines.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"> Because we have a few different systems for the Duramax, install \r\n  difficulty and times will vary. For example; The AirDog II, FP100 and Raptor \r\n  pump kits do not require you to drop the tank to install the system. Because \r\n  of our OEM style quick connect fittings and internal pump design on the AirDog \r\n  II, you will simply hook the suction line to the factory fitting on the fuel \r\n  tank sending unit. However, if you're going to install an AirDog FP150, this \r\n  will require dropping the tank to install a 1/2&quot; suction tube. None of \r\n  the Raptor kits require a suction tube to be installed. </p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">As for the rest of the install, for fuel supply, all of the systems \r\n  will either hook to the factory steel feed line that runs up to the engine or \r\n  the line directly on the engine, we give the choice of hooking to either spot \r\n  based on your mechanical capabilities. On the AirDog and AirDog II systems, \r\n  the entrained air and un-used fuel will be sent from the system back to the \r\n  tank through the fuel filler tube. Also, the factory fuel filter housing will \r\n  remain in use when using any of the AirDog or Raptor fuel systems. </p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Many people ask why the AirDog II, with its higher flow rate doesn't \r\n  need the 1/2&quot; suction tube. The reason for that is the way the AirDog II \r\n  is designed internally. The AirDog II recycles fuel back through the base to \r\n  keep the system constantly full, therefore returning less and making it a true \r\n  ON Demand system. Also, all of the AirDog and AirDog II systems have a built \r\n  in pressure port on the top of the base directly above the fuel filter, it's \r\n  plugged with an 1/8&quot; pipe plug and can be removed and utilized to check \r\n  pressure from. </p>"

    "description": "<p align=\"left\">Air/vapor in diesel fuel is a common problem with any diesel vehicle where the fuel tank is located at a lower point than the engine. The movement of the fuel inside the tank, and the process of fuel transfer under these conditions creates as much as 10% air/vapor within the fuel. Symptoms of air/vapor can be low horsepower, poor fuel mileage, excessive smoke, injector failure, hard starting, surging and rough running.

The early 12V engines with the Bosch VE6 rotary pumps are great engines and they'll last forever when taken care of. They're easy to work on and with a small budget you can get some respectable power and torque out of the Gen I Cummins. We still work on these engines providing service, maintenance and performance upgrades all the time. In fact, a few of our crew members still own a Gen I 12v Cummins. Fortunately, there is still an abundance of genuine OEM stock replacement Holset turbochargers available for these trucks. If you're doing some fueling upgrades such as fuel pump and injectors, then our Holset aftermarket performance turbo upgrades are a must. When it comes to the 1988 - 1993 Dodge 5.9L turbochargers, you have come to the right place."

As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones.

The 48RE transmissions were really designed for about 570 lb-ft of torque from the factory. Meanwhile, the standard Cummins in this year range has peaked at 610 lb-ft from the factory. The limits of the 48RE transmission are quickly understood especially when performance modifications have been added to the vehicle.  Randy’s Transmissions understand the limits of the 48RE and really knows what it takes to make a reliable 48RE hold up to whatever the end user is doing with their Dodge Cummins pickup. Randy has spent 1,000’s of hours building, designing, and breaking transmissions to gain the knowledge and understanding what it takes to build a 48RE to the level you need. That’s why Randy’s transmissions have more new replacement parts than any other remanufacture in the industry.

On the 2nd Gen trucks the turbocharger is mounted on the middle of the exhaust manifold while the 3rd and 4th gen is located at the back. In theory, the exhaust pulse in the central location is much more efficient for turbo spool. This location is much easier to get to and makes future modifications a lot easier. Not only being less restrictive than the stock 3rd and 4th Gen manifold, you will be installing a more reliable NON-VGT turbocharger in place of the stock unit.

    "description": "Heat is one of the biggest threats to overall powertrain longevity. As a gearhead, battling excessive temperatures is an ongoing trend. However, there are a multitude of various condensers designed to tackle high temperatures. One of the biggest changes to excessive Exhaust Gas Temperatures is to upgrade your factory intercooler. The factory unit is subpar at best, debilitating any efforts of overall heat reduction. To only enhance the shortcomings of the factory cooler, over time it becomes plugged with bugs, dirt, and other debris, severely hampering its overall cooling capability. Aftermarket intercoolers feature larger end tanks for greater air flow, thicker and denser cores, and just overall better construction. All of these same upgrades are also built into most of the upgraded radiators and transmission coolers as well. Also, we carry a wide selection of upgraded intercooler boots in silicone and Nomex and as well as clamps to insure you do not have a problem of a (blown boot) or the failure of the cheap rubber ones."

You can quickly find yourself having to build around a large turbocharger ~ often to get the same performance you could have gotten from a smaller turbo without the problems or extra costs associated with doing so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We've been installing upgraded turbos for well over two decades and feel we have enough experience to put our customers into a turbocharger that fits their needs. To do this, and help clear up the confusion, we put together a selection of  turbochargers below that are simple, straight forward to install, that may only require a small amount of extra fueling to perform.  These turbos are excellent in quality, have been proven to perform, and are designed to run with your emissions intact. Anytime you upgrade to a larger turbo you will have more turbo lag. Turbo lag is the response time it takes for the turbo to spool up. The more turbo lag you have, the more smoke and less drive-ability you will have. We recommend a tuner to help that turbo spool up quicker so you will have less smoke, lower EGT’s, and make the drive more enjoyable.  If you don’t have a tuner already and need help on choosing the best one that fits your needs or if you want more options on the turbo’s please feel free to call us.</p><br><style>\r\nh2.wsm-store-header {display: none;}\r\nli.wsm-cat-brand-li {display: none;}\r\n</style>"

This helps increase fuel mileage, horsepower and torque, all while extending the life of your injection system parts.</p>\r\n<br><div class=\"QuickTitle\"><p style=\"text-align: center;\">All Diesel Engines Need a ‘State of the Art’ Fuel Filtration Delivery System!</p></div>\r\n<p>The solution for diesel performance is the AirDog ® Fuel Preporator ®. It is the only filtration delivery system that separates air from the fuel, as well as water and particulates. This fuel system maintains the proper pressure flow to the transfer pump, eliminating cavitation and vapor. The Fuel Preporator significantly improves diesel engine performance and is one of a very few aftermarket performance modifications to be CARB certified and approved for sale and use in California.</p>"

New trucks are capable of towing 30,000+ pounds. This consistent increase in towing capability pushed the need for us to create a trailer hitch that could match and/or exceed the tow rating of new trucks in addition to providing the versatility necessary to tow multiple trailers at different ride heights. Our solution to this ongoing issue was to create the ultimate trailer hitch to surpass anything the industry had seen before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Available in 2.0\", 2.5\" and 3.0\" Shank Size.  2.0\" and 2.5\" available in Medium Duty, Heavy Duty and Extreme Duty.  3.0\" Available in Heavy Duty and Extreme Duty only.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>MEDIUM DUTY:</b> 14,000 LBS Towing Capacity - 2,000 LBS Tongue Weight Capacity</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>HEAVY DUTY:</b> 22,000 LBS Towing Capacity - 3,000 LBS Tongue Weight Capacity</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>EXTREME DUTY: </b> 36,000 LBS Towing Capacity - 6,000 LBS Tongue Weight Capacity</p>\r\n<br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe width=\"845\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YLtRpzdZA5g\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<style>\r\ndiv#wsm-cat-brands-catid-1209805 {\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\nh2.wsm-store-header.wsm-cat-header {\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\n</style>"
